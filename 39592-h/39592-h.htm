</div><div class='center'><span class='small'><i>Painting by</i> W. RUSSELL FLINT, A.R.W.S., <i>and Drawings
by</i> C. E. BROCK</span><br /><br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">People</span> have tried a holiday in bed before now, and found it a failure,
but that was because they were ignorant of the rules. They went to
bed with the open intention of staying there, say, three days, and found
to their surprise that each morning they wanted to get up. This was
a novel experience to them; they flung about restlessly, and probably
shortened their holiday. The proper thing is to take your holiday in
bed with a vague intention of getting up in another quarter of an hour.
The real pleasure of lying in bed after you are awake is largely due to
the feeling that you ought to get up. To take another quarter of an
hour then becomes a luxury. You are, in short, in the position of the
man who dined on larks. Had he seen the hundreds that were ready
for him, all set out on one monster dish, they would have alarmed him;
but getting them two at a time, he went on eating till all the larks were
gone. His feeling of uncertainty as to whether these might not be his
last two larks is your feeling that, perhaps, you will have to get up in
a quarter of an hour. Deceive yourself in this way, and your holiday
in bed will pass only too quickly.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Sympathy is what all the world is craving for, and sympathy is
what the ordinary holiday-maker never gets. How can we be expected
to sympathise with you when we know you are off to Perthshire to
fish? No; we say we wish we were you, and forget that your holiday
is sure to be a hollow mockery; that your child will jam her finger in
the railway carriage, and scream to the end of the journey; that you
will lose your luggage; that the guard will notice your dog beneath
the seat, and insist on its being paid for; that you will be caught in a
Scotch mist on the top of a mountain, and be put on gruel for a
fortnight; that your wife will fret herself into a fever about the way
the servant, who has been left at home, is treating her cousins, the
milkman, and the policeman; and that you will be had up for trespassing.
Yet, when you tell us you are off to-morrow, we have never
the sympathy to say, "Poor fellow, I hope you'll pull through somehow."
If it is an exhibition you go to gaze at, we never picture
you dragging your weary legs from one department to another,
and wondering why your back aches. Should it be the seaside, we
talk heartlessly to you about the "briny," though we must know,
if we would stop to think, that if there is one holiday more miserable
than all the others, it is that spent at the seaside, when you wander
along the weary beach and fling pebbles at the sea, and wonder how
long it will be till dinner-time. Were we to come down to see
you, we should probably find you, not on the beach, but moving
slowly through the village, looking in at the one milliner's window,
or laboriously reading what the one grocer's labels say on the subject
of pale ale, compressed beef, or vinegar. There was never an object
that called aloud for sympathy more than you do, but you get not
a jot of it. You should take the first train home and go to bed
for three days.</p>

<p>To enjoy your holiday in bed to the full, you should let it be
vaguely understood that there is something amiss with you. Don't
go into details, for they are not necessary; and, besides, you want to
be dreamy more or less, and the dreamy state is not consistent with a
definite ailment. The moment one takes to bed he gets sympathy.
He may be suffering from a tearing headache or a tooth that makes
him cry out; but if he goes about his business, or even flops in a chair,
true sympathy is denied him. Let him take to bed with one of those
illnesses of which he can say with accuracy that he is not quite certain
what is the matter with him, and his wife, for instance, will want to
bathe his brow. She must not be made too anxious. That would not
only be cruel to her, but it would wake you from the dreamy state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
She must simply see that you are "not yourself." Women have an
idea that unless men are "not themselves" they will not take to bed,
and as a consequence your wife is tenderly thoughtful of you. Every
little while she will ask you if you are feeling any better now, and
you can reply, with the old regard for truth, that you are "much
about it." You may even (for your own pleasure) talk of getting
up now, when she will earnestly urge you to stay in bed until you
feel easier. You consent; indeed, you are ready to do anything to
please her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_011.png" width="500" height="356" alt="At the shore" />
<span class="caption">And wonder how long it will be till dinner-time</span>
</div>

<p>The ideal holiday in bed does not require the presence of a
ministering angel in the room all day. You frequently prefer to be
alone, and point out to her that you cannot have her trifling with her
health for your sake, and so she must go out for a walk. She is
reluctant, but finally goes, protesting that you are the most unselfish
of men, and only too good for her. This leaves a pleasant aroma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
behind it, for even when lying in
bed, we like to feel that we are
uncommonly fine fellows. After she
has gone you get up cautiously,
and, walking stealthily to the wardrobe,
produce from the pocket of
your greatcoat a good novel. A
holiday in bed must be arranged for
beforehand. With a gleam in your
eye you slip back to bed, double your
pillow to make it higher, and begin
to read. You have only got to
the fourth page, when you make a
horrible discovery&mdash;namely, that the
book is not cut. An experienced
holiday-maker would have had it cut the night before, but this is your
first real holiday, or perhaps you have been thoughtless. In any case
you have now matter to think of. You are torn in two different ways.
There is your coat on the floor with a knife in it, but you cannot reach
the coat without getting up again. Ought you to get the knife or to
give up reading? Perhaps it takes a quarter of an hour to decide this
question, and you decide it by discovering a third course. Being a
sort of an invalid, you have certain privileges which would be denied
you if you were merely sitting in a chair in the agonies of neuralgia.
One of the glorious privileges of a holiday in bed is that you are
entitled to cut books with your fingers. So you cut the novel in
this way, and read on.</p>

<p>Those who have never tried it may fancy that there is a lack of
incident in a holiday in bed. There could not be a more monstrous
mistake. You are in the middle of a chapter, when suddenly you hear
a step upon the stairs. Your loving ears tell you that the ministering
angel has returned, and is hastening to you. Now, what happens?
The book disappears beneath the pillow, and when she enters the room
softly you are lying there with your eyes shut. This is not merely
incident; it is drama.</p>

<p>What happens next depends on circumstances. She says, in
a low voice:</p>

<p>"Are you feeling any easier now, John?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe he is sleeping."</p>

<p>Then she steals from the room, and you begin to read again.</p>

<p>During a holiday in bed one
never thinks, of course, of analysing
his actions. If you had done so in
this instance, you would have seen
that you pretended sleep because
you had got to an exciting passage.
You love your wife, but, wife or
no wife, you must see how the
passage ends.</p>

<p>Possibly the little scene plays
differently, as thus:</p>

<p>"John, are you feeling any
easier now?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"What a pity! I don't want to waken him, and yet the fowl
will be spoilt."</p>

<p>"Is that you back, Marion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; I thought you were asleep."</p>

<p>"No, only thinking."</p>

<p>"You think too much, dear. I have cooked a chicken for you."</p>

<p>"I have no appetite."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, but I can give it to the children."</p>

<p>"Oh, as it's cooked, you may as well bring it up."</p>

<span class="caption">You are lying there with your
eyes shut</span>
</div>

<p>In that case the reason of your change of action is obvious. But
why do you not let your wife
know that you have been reading?
This is another matter that you
never reason about. Perhaps it is
because of your craving for sympathy,
and you fear that if you
were seen enjoying a novel the
sympathy would go. Or perhaps
it is that a holiday in bed is never
perfect without a secret. Monotony
must be guarded against, and so
long as you keep the book to yourself
your holiday in bed is a healthy
excitement. A stolen book (as we
may call it) is like stolen fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sweeter than what you can devour openly. The boy enjoys his stolen
apple because at any moment he may have to slip it down the leg of his
trousers and pretend that he has merely climbed the tree to enjoy the
scenery. You enjoy your book doubly because you feel that it is
a forbidden pleasure. Or do you conceal your book from your wife
lest she should think you are over-exerting yourself? She must not
be made anxious on your account? Ah, that is it.</p>

<p>People who pretend (for it must be pretence) that they enjoy
their holiday in the country, explain that the hills or the sea give them
such an appetite. I could never myself feel the delight of being able to
manage an extra herring for breakfast, but it should be pointed out that
neither mountains nor oceans give you such an appetite as a holiday in
bed. What makes people eat more anywhere is that they have nothing
else to do, and in bed you have lots of time for meals. As for the
quality of the food supplied, there is no comparison. In the highlands
it is ham and eggs all day till you sicken. At the seaside it is fish till
the bones stick in your mouth. But in bed&mdash;oh, there you get something
worth eating. You don't take three big meals a day, but twelve
little ones, and each time it is something different from the last. There
are delicacies for breakfast, for your four luncheons and your five
dinners. You explain to your wife that you have lost your appetite,
and she believes you, but at the same time she has the sense to hurry
on your dinner. At the clatter of dishes (for which you have been
lying listening) you raise your poor head, and say faintly:</p>

<p>"Really, Marion, I can't touch food."</p>

<p>"But this is nothing," she says, "only the wing of a partridge."</p>

<p>You take a side glance at it, and see that there is also the
other wing and the body and two legs. Your alarm thus dispelled,
you say:</p>

<p>"I really can't."</p>

<p>"But, dear, it is so beautifully cooked."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I have no appetite."</p>

<p>"But try to take it, John, for my sake."</p>

<p>Then for her sake you say she can leave it on the chair, and
perhaps you will just taste it. As soon as she has gone you
devour that partridge, and when she comes back she has the sense
to say:</p>

<p>"Why, you have scarcely eaten anything. What could you
take for supper?"</p>

<p>You say you can take nothing, but if she likes she can cook a large
sole, only you won't be able to touch it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor dear," she says, "your appetite has completely gone,"
and then she rushes to the kitchen to cook the sole with her own
hands. In half an hour she steals into your room with it, and then
you (who have been wondering why she is so long) start up
protesting:</p>

<p>"I hope, Marion, this is nothing for me."</p>

<p>"Only the least bit of a sole, dear."</p>

<p>"But I told you I could eat nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, this is nothing, it is so small."</p>

<p>You look again, and see with relief that it is a large sole.</p>


<p>"I would much rather that you took it away."</p>

<p>"But, dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you I have no appetite."</p>

<p>"Of course I know that; but how can you hope to preserve your
strength if you eat so little? You have
had nothing all day."</p>

<p>You glance at her face to see if
she is in earnest, for you can remember
three breakfasts, four luncheons and
two dinners; but evidently she is not
jesting. Then you yield.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, to keep my health up
I may just put a fork into it."</p>

<p>"Do, dear; it will do you good,
though you have no caring for it."</p>

<p>Take a holiday in bed, if only to
discover what an angel your wife is.</p>


<p>There is one thing to guard
against. Never call it a holiday.
Continue not to feel sure what is
wrong with you, and to talk vaguely
of getting up presently. Your wife
will suggest calling in the doctor,
but pooh-pooh him. Be firm on that
point. The chances are that he won't
understand your case.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE SPY</h2>

<div class='center'>BY G. A. BIRMINGHAM<br />

<i>Drawings by</i> H. R. MILLAR</div>

<div class='copyright'><br /><i>Copyright in the U.S.A. by G. A. Birmingham</i></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Our</span> village used to be one of the quietest in England. We prided
ourselves that nothing ever happened there to excite or worry us in any
way. Colonel Challenger, of the Royal Engineers, retired, often congratulated
the vicar, who is upwards of sixty-five years of age, on the
unbroken peace which we enjoyed. The vicar used to remind me, once
a fortnight or so, that we owed our happiness largely to the fact that
we were eight miles from a railway station. When I met Hankly, a
retired Indian judge, in the post office I invariably pointed out to him
that our lot would be much less pleasant if we lived in a neighbourhood
where tennis parties were rife or among people who expected us to turn
out in the evenings after dinner to play cards. Lord Manby, who owns
the village and all the country round it, used to pay a visit to his home
every year and ask us each to lunch with him once. We all accepted
these invitations, but we told each other that they were a horrible
nuisance and a most disagreeable break in the monotony of our lives.
I think we were all quite honest and really believed that we were
perfectly happy.</div>

<p>Then Mrs. Clegg C. Mimms rented the Manor House from Lord
Manby, and all peace came to an end for us. She described herself on
her visiting cards as "the Honourable Mrs. Mimms," and that disturbed
us to begin with. We had to meet each other pretty frequently to
discuss how she could be the Honourable Mrs. anything. She was plainly
and unmistakably an American, and the vicar was of opinion that, since
there are no titles in the American Republic, neither Mrs. Mimms nor
her late husband could be the descendant of a lord. Hankly, who has
seen a great deal of the world, told us that American ambassadors are
styled the Right Honourable, and that Mrs. Mimms's husband might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
have been an ambassador. The Colonel maintained that ambassadors
are like bishops and cannot share their official titles with their wives,
particularly after they are dead. My own view was that if Mrs. Mimms
wanted to be styled "the Honourable" it would be discourteous to deny
her the title.</p>

<p>We had hardly settled down again after deciding this point when
Mrs. Mimms upset us still more seriously. She gave a Christmas Tree
to the village children. At first we thought that this would not matter
to any one except the vicar. We were mistaken about that. Mrs. Mimms
made us all help. The Colonel and I spent a long afternoon
on a step-ladder sticking candles on the branches. Hankly, who is a
lean, yellow little man, was made to dress himself up as "Father
Christmas." We got no dinner on the evening of the party, and very
nearly had to dance with the children afterwards. The presents which
Mrs. Mimms distributed to the children were of the most gorgeous and
expensive kind. We all agreed that she must be enormously rich, and
the Colonel said that she would demoralise the whole village.</p>

<p>She certainly demoralised us. We found ourselves invited to
dinner at the Manor House twice, sometimes three times, a week, and
had a standing invitation to supper every Sunday night. It was no
use refusing the invitations. I tried that twice; but Mrs. Mimms
simply came round to my house in her motor and fetched me. The
Colonel complained bitterly. He has been writing a book on Chhota
Nagpur ever since I knew him, and he said that he hated being interrupted
in the evenings. He only dined with Mrs. Mimms in order to
avoid unpleasantness with his wife, who wanted to go. Hankly said
plainly that Mrs. Mimms had a very good cook, and we all came in the
end to accept that as our excuse for dining with her.</p>

<p>It is, I know, scarcely credible, but last Easter she dragged us
into private theatricals. By that time we had agreed that Mrs. Mimms,
in spite of her annoying lack of repose, was a very kind-hearted woman,
and we did not wish to snub her in any way. My own part in the
play let me in for a love scene with Mrs. Challenger, the most
grotesquely absurd thing imaginable, for the lady is sixty at least and
enormously fat. I should never have agreed to do it, however good-hearted
Mrs. Mimms might be, if Hankly had not been cast for the
part of an heroic Christian curate, and I knew he would look even more
foolish than I did when I kissed Mrs. Challenger's left ear. Hankly
hated being an heroic Christian curate and did not do the part at all
well. We got through the theatricals in June, and after that, except for a
couple of picnics every week, we had a comparatively quiet time until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
war broke out. Mrs. Mimms broke out at the same time. All festivities,
even picnics, stopped at once, of course, and we all began to take life very
strenuously. Mrs. Mimms outdid us easily in every form of activity.</p>

<p>She began by erecting a flag-staff at the Manor House gates and
hoisting an enormous American flag on it, the largest American flag
I have ever seen. The Colonel, who had his motor decorated with
a French and a Belgian flag as well as a Union Jack, said that Mrs.
Mimms's Stars and Stripes were, under the circumstances, rather bad
form. Hankly and I agreed with him, and we made the vicar speak to
her about it. She explained to him that she had hoisted it entirely for
our good. It was, so she told the vicar, and he told us, the only flag
in the world which the Germans would respect, and that when the
Uhlans entered our village we could all congregate in perfect safety
under its folds. The Colonel was furious&mdash;we were all rather angry&mdash;at
the idea that the Germans would ever set foot in England; but there
was no denying that Mrs. Mimms meant to be kind when she hoisted
the flag. Besides, she is a difficult woman to argue with, and we did
not quite see how we could make her take the thing down.</p>

<p>Hankly and I more or less forgave her, though, as it appeared, the
Colonel did not, when she came forward at a meeting summoned
by the vicar and offered to turn the Manor House into a hospital
for wounded soldiers. The generosity of her proposal actually staggered
us. She intended, so she said&mdash;and I quite believe it&mdash;to
turn out all the existing furniture of the house, fit the place up
with the latest sanitary devices, hire two surgeons and a competent
staff of nurses who should be under her own personal supervision. We
at once wired to the War Office and expected to be thanked gratefully.
As a matter of fact we never got any official acknowledgment
of the offer at all. What we did get&mdash;or rather what Mrs. Mimms
got&mdash;was a letter from Lord Manby's solicitor pointing out that the
agreement under which she had taken the Manor House did not allow
of her getting rid of the furniture or using the place in any way except
as an ordinary dwelling.</p>

<p>I thought that Lord Manby was a little unsympathetic, and that
the War Office might very well have replied to our telegram, but the
Colonel took quite a different line. He said that Mrs. Mimms was an
interfering old woman who deserved to be snubbed. We all hoped that
after this set-back she would be a little subdued and allow us to manage
our own war in our own way.</p>



<p>For a time she kept tolerably quiet. She contented herself with
making shirts and subscribing to various funds like any ordinary woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
She was, so my wife told me, an amazingly rapid worker, and could
turn out three shirts while any other woman in the village was making
two. Her subscriptions were very generous. Gradually the whole
activities of our village centred in the Manor House. Mrs. Mimms
put up another flag-staff and flew a large Red Cross from it. Working
parties went on in her dining-room from morning to night, and hardly
a day passed without a committee meeting. The vicar, Colonel
Challenger, Hankly, and I were the committee, and we met whenever
Mrs. Mimms summoned us. The vicar was supposed to preside, but it
was Mrs. Mimms who suggested the things we did. The Colonel
objected, in private, to every suggestion she made, but he never succeeded
in carrying a point against her. Once or twice she got us into
trouble. There was, for instance, a lot of ill feeling when we sealed up
the village pump and set my chauffeur to keep guard over it with a gun,
only allowing people to draw water for an hour in the morning and an
hour in the evening. Mrs. Mimms had a theory that a German might
come in an aeroplane and poison our water supply. That would have
been a horrible thing: but the people in the village made a fuss about
not being able to get at the pump. Tompkins, the innkeeper, who
was particularly objectionable, said that he only used the water for
washing and would rather have it poisoned than do without it.</p>

<p>We all began to get rather tired of being rushed into doing things
we didn't want to do; but we were none of us able to withstand
Mrs. Mimms. The Colonel said that we ought to drive her out of the
village altogether, but he never succeeded in suggesting any practical
way of doing it.</p>

<p>Fortunately she got tired of making shirts and holding committee
meetings after about a month. Then she said she was going up to
London to get a few families of Belgian refugees. We were all greatly
pleased, for we felt that her energies might be turned into a channel
which would save us from making fools of ourselves. I saw her off at
the station, and we waited with the greatest curiosity to see what would
happen. I suppose the Belgian Consul felt doubtful about Mrs. Mimms
when he met her. At all events she came back without a single
refugee. Most women would have been a little disappointed at a
failure like that, but Mrs. Mimms was as full of energy as ever. She
had, it appeared, called at several public offices in London and had
been immensely impressed by the Boy Scouts whom she saw waiting
about the doors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/i_025.png" width="453" height="575" alt="pump and chauffeur" />
<span class="caption">We sealed up the village pump and set my chauffeur to keep guard</span>
</div>

<p>"They're the cutest things I've seen in England," she said, "and
their bare knees are just sweet. I could kiss them all day. I simply
must have a couple to stand on guard while the working parties are
going on."</p>

<p>I talked to the vicar, Hankly, and the Colonel about this. I did
not see how we could possibly provide Mrs. Mimms with Boy Scouts,
for there were none in the parish. The vicar said he was sorry that he
had not started the organisation long ago, but supposed it was too late
to do so now. To my surprise the Colonel, who up to that time had
been getting angrier and angrier with Mrs. Mimms, took her side and
said that if she wanted Boy Scouts she ought to have them. He
proposed that we should enrol four choir boys at once, and offered to
buy uniforms for them himself. The vicar was a little doubtful, but
Hankly and I backed up the Colonel. We were very tired of the
constant committee meetings, and we hoped that if Mrs. Mimms got
really interested in Boy Scouts she might let us alone. We acted
promptly, and in a week had four boys ready to stand on guard at the
doors of the Manor House.</p>

<p>The Colonel gave them a talking to at their first parade. He
impressed on them the fact that discipline and strict obedience to
orders are the essence of a military manhood. He quoted Tennyson,
and made the boys repeat the lines after him:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Theirs not to make reply,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Theirs not to reason why."</span><br />
</div>

<p>He succeeded in inspiring them with a tremendous sense of their
own importance. My idea was that he was trying to prepare them for
having their knees kissed by Mrs. Mimms.</p>

<p>For a time everything went well. The boys got off going to
school and were immensely pleased. Mrs. Mimms fed them with
dainties at odd hours of the day, and always had a basket of apples in
the porch from which they could help themselves. So far as I knew
she never attempted to kiss either their knees or any other part of
them. The Colonel kept on exhorting them. He paid them a visit
every morning, and insisted on their reporting themselves at his house
when they went off duty in the evening.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the boys first went on guard Mrs. Mimms
complained to the vicar that she had found one of them concealed under
the dining-room table while she was at luncheon. She said that she
did not like the feeling that she might kick a boy every time she
stretched her leg while she was at meals. The vicar, of course, promised
to speak to the boy.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Mimms made another complaint. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a><br /><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
boys had climbed up by some creepers, and was found by her maid
sitting on the window-sill of a bedroom early in the morning. It was
not Mrs. Mimms's bedroom, but, as she explained, it might have been.
She had no particular objection, so she told the vicar, to a Boy Scout
in her bedroom at any reasonable hour, but she did not want the child
to break his neck.</p>

<p>Then the postmaster gave me a hint that Mrs. Mimms's letters,
which were posted every day by one of the Scouts, showed signs of
having been opened and closed again before they came into his hands.
He said that if this was being done by the Colonel's orders it was all
right, but he thought he ought to tell me about it. I met the vicar
in the street immediately afterwards and said I thought the Scouts
were getting out of hand and ought to be disbanded at once. He
agreed with me.</p>

<p>While we were discussing the matter Hankly came up to us and
said he heard that Mrs. Mimms was to be arrested at once as a German
spy.</p>

<p>"Tompkins," he said, "is going about the village saying that she
ought to be shot."</p>

<p>Tompkins always blamed Mrs. Mimms for the sealing up of the
village pump, and had never spoken a good word about her since. The
vicar was greatly put out.</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut!" he said; "arrested! shot! Nonsense. Mrs. Mimms
is a most estimable lady."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," said Hankly. "Those boys have
been watching her lately, and there are several things which look
suspicious."</p>

<p>I suppose the vicar and I showed our surprise. Hankly went on
to explain.</p>

<p>"She gives the boys peaches and grapes," he said, "and cakes and
meringues. Now I put it to you&mdash;the apples of course I understand. I
might give a boy an apple myself, but I put it to you, vicar, would
anybody give boys like that hothouse grapes and peaches unless&mdash;well,
unless there was something to conceal. It's not a natural thing
to do."</p>

<p>"Now I come to think of it," said the vicar, "I did meet one of
them yesterday with a peach in his fist."</p>

<p>"There you are," said Hankly triumphantly, "and, anyhow, the
police inspector is coming over to-day to look into the matter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mimms was not actually arrested. The police inspector&mdash;acting
on information received from the Boy Scouts, Tompkins, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
indeed almost every one in the village&mdash;made a lot of inquiries about
her. He did not succeed in finding out why she called herself "the
Honourable," but the questions he asked her made her so angry that she
packed up her trunks and left the village at once.</p>

<p>I met the Colonel the day after she left, and told him I was afraid
we should all miss her. The Colonel chuckled in a self-satisfied way.</p>

<p>"I told you we ought to get rid of her," he said, "and we have."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you think she was really a spy?" I said.</p>

<p>"She was a good deal worse," said the Colonel; "she was a public
nuisance."</p>

<p>Later on the Colonel took a kindlier view of Mrs. Mimms.</p>

<p>"Only for her," he said to me a week ago, "we shouldn't have had
Boy Scouts here. We have quite a good company now. She did us
that much good, anyhow."</p>

<p>The Colonel did her no more than bare justice. Our Scouts,
though they have caught no more spies, have improved the general tone
of the village. The Colonel is their commanding officer, and, though
I do not say so in public, they have done him a lot of good.</p>

Charlie saved every soul, and lost not a hand of his own. When the
"traveller" was rigged and the "breeches" were ready, and the crew
of the doomed ship were at the bulwarks waiting to leave her, Charlie
sang out over the clamour of the sea:</p>

<p>"How many are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-four," came back as answer.</p>

<p>Then Charlie cried, "I can see only twenty-three."</p>

<p>"The other man is hurt. He's dying. No use saving him," the
Norseman shouted.</p>

<p>"You'll bring the dying man on deck before a soul of you leaves
the ship," cried Charlie.</p>

<p>There was a woman among them, and when the carpenter came
scudding down the rope he had a canvas bag on his back.</p>

<p>"No tools here," shouted Charlie.</p>

<p>"It's the child," said the man.</p>

<p>The captain came next. He had left everything
else behind him&mdash;his money, his instruments, his clothes,
his ship&mdash;but out of his pocket there peeped the
head of a baby's doll.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling rescue, but to see it in all
its splendour you must have a drop of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Manx blood in you. Our forefathers were from Norway, our first
Norse king was named Gorry. He landed on this island, not far
from this spot. And on that day of the wreck of the <i>St. George</i> his
children's children rescued from the sea the children's children of the
kinsmen he had left at home.</p>

<p>Most of our men had Norse names. One of them was a Gorry,
lineal descendant beyond doubt of the old sea king. The Norwegian
Government felt the touch of great things in this incident. It was not
merely that the bravery of the rescue fired their gratitude. Something
called to them from that deep place where blood answers to the cry of
blood. They sent medals for Charlie and his crew, and the Governor
of the island distributed them inside the roofless walls of the old castle
of the "Black Dog." It was like grasping hands with the past across
the space of a thousand years.</p>

<p>The other day we had another great wind and another brave rescue.
The sun had gone down overnight in a sullen red, very fierce and angry
in his setting, and out of the black north-east the storm had come up
while we slept. In the heavy grey of the dawn the sound-signal fired
its double shot over our little town. A Welsh schooner, which had run
in for shelter during the dark hours, was riding to an anchor in the bay
and flying her ensign for help.</p>

<p>The sea was terrific&mdash;a slaty grey, streaked with white foam, like
quartz veins. It was coming over the breakwater in sheets that hid it.
Sometimes it was flying in clouds to the top of the round tower of the
castle. The white sea-fowl were like dark specks darting through it,
but no human ear could hear the cry of their thousand throats
in the thunderous quake of the breakers on the cavernous rocks.</p>

<p>A crowd of men answered the call, and there was no shortness
of hands to man the lifeboat. The big, slow-legged fellows
who had been idling on the quay the day before when the sea
was calm were struggling, chafing, and quarrelling to go out on
it now that it was in storm, for the blood of the old Vikings is in
our Manxmen still.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_030.png" width="600" height="423" alt="ocean" />
</div>

<p>It was a splendid rescue. The crew of the Welshman were
brought ashore. Then the abandoned schooner rode three hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
longer in the gale, and a hundred men stood and watched her, talking
of other winds and other wrecks, and of Peel boys who were out on
the sea. At last the ship parted her cables and went rolling like a
blinded porpoise dead on for the jagged coast.</p>

<p>Seven men took an open fishing-boat and went after her, and we
climbed the Head to look at them. The wind smote us there like an
invisible wing, sometimes swirling us out of our course, often bringing
us to our knees, and whipping our ears with our hair like rods. Sheets
of spray were coming up to us from below and running along the cliffs
like driven rain. The sun, which had broken in fierce brilliance from a
green rent in the sky, made rainbows in the flying foam.</p>

<p>From the heights we watched the seven men and the open boat.
They rose and fell, appeared and disappeared, but they overtook the
Welshman before she had drifted on to the coast, boarded her with
difficulty, let go another anchor and made her tight. There was
nothing else to do, for she was disabled, and her sails were torn to
shreds. The new anchor held the ship an hour longer, and then there
was no help left for her. She was within a hundred feet of the rocks,
and she fell on them with the groan of a living creature.</p>

<p>The instant her head was down the white lions of the sea leapt
over her, the water swirled through her bulwarks and plunged down
her hatch; her helm was unshipped, her sails were torn from their
gaskets, and the floating home wherein men had sailed and sung and
slept and laughed and jested was a broken wreck in the heavy wallowings
of the waves.</p>

<p>When it was over and we were coming back, drenched through
and green with the drift of the sea foam caked thick on our faces,
some of us began to think of Charlie. He had not been there that day.
A year or more ago, in the prime of a splendid manhood, he was
stricken by heart disease. He kept a good heart, nevertheless, and by
indomitable will held on for some time. First a little work, then no
work at all, only a sail now and then if the sea was calm, but of late
hardly ever well enough to take the open air. The old hulk of his poor
body had been anchored deep, but she was parting her cables at last.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_031.png" width="600" height="249" alt="ocean" />
</div>

<p>Charlie lay dying while this second rescue was being made. He
had not answered the signal for the lifeboat, but he had heard it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
fierce light of morning, and they could not keep him in
bed. The soul of the old sea dog leapt to the call, but
his ailing body held him down. He wanted to go out.
Wasn't he cox? Had the boat ever gone out without
him?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/i_032a.png" width="217" height="450" alt="Fisherman" />
</div>

<p>His house is one of the little places like children's
Noah's arks which dot the line of this hungry shore.
He could hear everything and see a good deal. Often
he could hardly keep himself from crying and shouting
aloud. In spirit he was out on the boiling surf, dipping,
rising, stooping, going over, righting again, clambering
back, exulting, glorying, getting nearer the ship, standing
off her, rigging the "traveller," and fetching men aboard
in the "breeches." And then away from the rolling hulk,
and sing ho, my lads, and haul through the white waves for home. But
his poor dying body was down on the bed and his face was sickly scarlet.</p>

<p>Charlie's volcanic soul did not go off to the deep of deeps on the
big breakers and through the wild noises of the storm. He died later.
After the great wind there came a great calm. The air was quiet and
full of the odour of seaweed; banks of seaweed were on the shore, and
the broken schooner was covered with brown wrack, like any rock of
the coast; the sky was round as the inside of a shell, and pale pink
like the shadow of flame; the water was smooth, and land and sea lay
like a sleeping child. In this broad and steady weather our little town
was startled by the double shot again. We went to the windows in
surprise, and saw the red flag over the rocket house, which is the signal
for the lifeboat.</p>

<p>Charlie was dead. He had just breathed his last, and his rugged
comrades, who know nothing of poetry, but are poets nevertheless to the
deepest grain of them, had run up the flag mast-high (not half-mast) as
signal to the Great Cox of all that here was a soul in the troubled
waters of death waiting for the everlasting lifeboat to bear him to the
eternal shore.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_032b.png" width="500" height="259" alt="In row boats" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The sea takes some of our bravest and best. Charlie it did not
take. Not so sure is it that he who lives by the sword will perish
by the sword, as that he who baulks the sea the sea will surely have for
its prey. Charlie had battled with the giant time and again, but he
has gone to sleep on the land.</p>

<p>We buried him to-day in the little cemetery looking on to the grey
water that was more than half his element. The funeral was beautiful
in its old simplicity. First a hymn at the door of the house in the little
alley by the beach, "Safe in the arms of Jesus," with the coffin on the
ground and all standing round; the sea quiet, hardly a breeze as soft as
human breath moving its tranquil surface; the deadly rival in its everlasting
coming and going making no triumphant clamour now the sea-warrior
was down. Then the companions of his dangers, the crew of
his boat, a group of stalwart fellows who have never known what it is to
be afraid, carrying him up the hill, shoulder high, each in his red stocking
cap and his life-belt, emblems of how they had fought the sea and
beaten it.</p>

<p>There were some of us whose eyes were wet, but if these brave boys
wept at all, it was only for the helpless little ones left behind. For
Charlie they did not weep. His spirit is not dead for them&mdash;it cannot
die. When brave deeds have to be done, they will see its light, like a
beacon that does not fail, over the mountains of the fiercest storm; they
will hear its voice above the thunder of the loudest waves.</p>

<p>A full moon is shining to-night on the place of Charlie's rest, and if
the old Norse story is true, that while the body lies in sight of the sea the
spirit lives in the winds above it, Charlie is not done with his old enemy
yet. He will come back to this sea-bound land in warning whispers of
the mighty and mysterious power that lures men to itself.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the days when the tide of Mahdism,
which had swept in such a flood from the
Great Lakes and Darfur to the confines of
Egypt, had at last come to its full, and even
begun, as some hoped, to show signs of a
turn. At its outset it had been terrible. It
had engulfed Hicks's army, swept over Gordon
and Khartoum, rolled behind the British forces
as they retired down the river, and finally cast up a
spray of raiding parties as far north as Assouan.
Then it found other channels to east and west, to
Central Africa and to Abyssinia, and retired a little
on the side of Egypt. For ten years there ensued a
lull, during which the frontier garrisons looked out
upon those distant blue hills of Dongola. Behind
the violet mists which draped them lay a land of
blood and horror. From time to time some adventurer
went south towards those haze-girt mountains, tempted by stories
of gum and ivory, but none ever returned. Once a mutilated Egyptian
and once a Greek woman, mad with thirst and fear, made their way
to the lines. They were the only exports of that country of darkness.
Sometimes the sunset would turn those distant mists into a bank of
crimson, and the dark mountains would rise from that sinister reek
like islands in a sea of blood. It seemed a grim symbol in the southern
heaven when seen from the fort-capped hills by Wady Halfa. Ten
years of lust in Khartoum, ten years of silent work in Cairo, and then
all was ready, and it was time for Civilisation to take a trip south
once more, travelling as her wont is in an armoured train. Everything
was ready, down to the last pack-saddle of the last camel, and
yet no one suspected it, for an unconstitutional Government has its
advantage. A great administrator had argued, and managed, and
cajoled; a great soldier had organised and planned, and made piastres
do the work of pounds. And then one night these two master spirits
met and clasped hands, and the soldier vanished away upon some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
business of his own. And just at that very time, Bimbashi Hilary
Joyce, seconded from the Royal Mallow Fusiliers, and temporarily
attached to the Ninth Soudanese, made his first appearance in Cairo.</div>
<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i_035b.png" width="345" height="250" alt="on camel" />
</div>
<p>Napoleon had said, and Hilary Joyce had noted, that great
reputations are only to be made in the East. Here he was in the
East with four tin cases of baggage, a Wilkinson sword, a Bond's
slug-throwing pistol, and a copy of "Green's Introduction to the
Study of Arabic." With such a start, and the blood of youth running
hot in his veins, everything seemed easy. He was a little frightened
of the general; he had heard stories of his sternness to young officers,
but with tact and suavity he hoped for the best. So, leaving his effects
at "Shepherd's Hotel," he reported himself at headquarters. It was
not the general, but the head of the Intelligence Department who
received him, the chief being still absent upon that business which
had called him. Hilary Joyce found himself in the presence of a short,
thick-set officer, with a gentle voice and a placid expression which
covered a remarkably acute and energetic spirit. With that quiet
smile and guileless manner he had undercut and outwitted the most
cunning of Orientals. He stood, a cigarette between his fingers,
looking at the newcomer. "I heard that you had come. Sorry the
chief isn't here to see you. Gone up to the frontier, you know."</p>

<p>"My regiment is at Wady Halfa. I suppose, sir, that I should
report myself there at once?"</p>

<p>"No; I was to give you your orders." He led the way to a map
upon the wall, and pointed with the end of his cigarette. "You see
this place. It's the Oasis of Kurkur&mdash;a little quiet, I am afraid, but
excellent air. You are to get out there as quick as possible. You'll
find a company of the Ninth, and half a squadron of cavalry. You will
be in command."</p>

<p>Hilary Joyce looked at the name, printed at the intersection of two
black lines without another dot upon the map for several inches around
it. "A village, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, a well. Not very good water, I'm afraid, but you soon get
accustomed to natron. It's an important post, as being at the junction
of two caravan routes. All routes are closed now, of course, but still
you never know who <i>might</i> come along them."</p>

<p>"We are there, I presume, to prevent raiding?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_036.png" width="550" height="132" alt="row of camels" />
</div>

<p>"Well, between you and me, there's really nothing to raid. You
are there to intercept messengers. They must call at the wells. Of
course you have only just come out, but you probably understand
already enough about the conditions of this country to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
there is a great deal of disaffection about, and that the Khalifa is
likely to try and keep in touch with his adherents. Then, again,
Senoussi lives up that way"&mdash;he waved his cigarette to the westward&mdash;"the
Khalifa might send a messenger to him along that route. Anyhow,
your duty is to arrest every one coming along, and get some
account of him before you let him go. You don't talk Arabic, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I am learning, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, well, you'll have time enough to study there. And you'll
have a native officer, Ali something or other, who speaks English,
and can interpret for you. Well, good-bye&mdash;I'll tell the chief that you
reported yourself. Get on to your post now as quickly as you can."</p>

</div>

<p>Railway to Baliani, the post-boat to Assouan, and then two day
on a camel in the Libyan desert, with an Ababdeh guide, and three
baggage-camels to tie one down to their own exasperating pace.
However, even two and a half miles an hour mount up in time, and
at last, on the third evening, from the blackened slag-heap of a hill
which is called the Jebel Kurkur, Hilary Joyce looked down upon a
distant clump of palms, and thought that this cool patch of green in
the midst of the merciless blacks and yellows was the fairest colour
effect that he had ever seen. An hour later he had ridden into the little
camp, the guard had turned out to salute him, his native subordinate
had greeted him in excellent English, and he had fairly entered into his
own. It was not an exhilarating place for a lengthy residence. There
was one large, bowl-shaped, grassy depression sloping down to the three
pits of brown and brackish water. There,
also, was the grove of palm trees beautiful
to look upon, but exasperating in view
of the fact that Nature has provided her
least shady trees on the very spot where
shade is needed most. A single wide-spread
acacia did something to restore the balance.
Here Hilary Joyce slumbered in the heat,
and in the cool he inspected his square-shouldered,
spindle-shanked Soudanese,
with their cheery black faces and their
funny little pork-pie forage caps. Joyce
was a martinet at drill, and the blacks
loved being drilled, so the Bimbashi was
soon popular among them. But one day
was exactly like another. The weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the view, the employment, the food&mdash;everything was the same. At
the end of three weeks he felt that he had been there for interminable
years. And then at last there came something to break the monotony.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 131px;">
<img src="images/i_038a.png" width="131" height="350" alt="palm trees" />
</div>

<p>One evening, as the sun was sinking, Hilary Joyce rode slowly
down the old caravan road. It had a fascination for him, this narrow
track, winding among the boulders and curving up the nullahs, for he
remembered how in the map it had gone on and on, stretching away
into the unknown heart of Africa. The countless pads of innumerable
camels through many centuries had beaten it smooth, so that now,
unused and deserted, it still wound away, the strangest of roads, a foot
broad, and perhaps two thousand miles in length. Joyce wondered as
he rode how long it was since any traveller had journeyed up it from the
south, and then he raised his eyes, and there was a man coming along
the path. For an instant Joyce thought that it might be one of his own
men, but a second glance assured him that this could not be so. The
stranger was dressed in the flowing robes of an Arab, and not in the
close-fitting khaki of a soldier. He was very tall, and a high turban
made him seem gigantic. He strode swiftly along, with head erect,
and the bearing of a man who knows no fear.</p>

<p>Who could he be, this formidable giant coming out of the
unknown? The precursor possibly of a horde of savage spearmen.
And where could he have walked from? The nearest well was a long
hundred miles down the track. At any rate the frontier post of Kurkur
could not afford to receive casual visitors. Hilary Joyce whisked round
his horse, galloped into camp, and gave the alarm. Then, with twenty
horsemen at his back, he rode out again to reconnoitre. The man was
still coming on in spite of these hostile preparations. For an instant he
hesitated when first he saw the cavalry, but escape was out of the
question, and he advanced with the air of a man who makes the best of
a bad job. He made no resistance, and said nothing when the hands
of two troopers clutched at his shoulders, but walked quietly between
their horses into camp. Shortly afterwards the patrol came in again.
There were no signs of any dervishes. The man was alone. A splendid
trotting camel had been found lying dead a little way down the track.
The mystery of the stranger's arrival was explained. But why, and
whence, and whither?&mdash;these were questions for which a zealous officer
must find an answer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_036.png" width="550" height="132" alt="row of camels" />
</div>

<p>Hilary Joyce was disappointed that there were no dervishes. It
would have been a great start for him in the Egyptian army had he
fought a little action on his own account. But even as it was, he had
a rare chance of impressing the authorities. He would love to show his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
capacity to the head of the Intelligence, and even more to that grim
chief who never forgot what was smart, or forgave what was slack.
The prisoner's dress and bearing showed that he was of importance.
Mean men do not ride pure-bred trotting camels. Joyce sponged his
head with cold water, drank a cup of strong coffee, put on an imposing
official tarboosh instead of his sun-helmet, and formed himself into a
court of inquiry and judgment under the acacia tree. He would have
liked his people to have seen him now, with his two black orderlies in
waiting, and his Egyptian native officer at his side. He sat behind a
camp-table, and the prisoner, strongly guarded, was led up to him. The
man was a handsome fellow, with bold grey eyes and a long black
beard.</p>

<p>"Why!" cried Joyce, "the rascal is making faces at me." A
curious contraction had passed over the man's features, but so swiftly
that it might have been a nervous twitch. He was now a model of
Oriental gravity. "Ask him who he is, and what he wants?" The
native officer did so, but the stranger made no reply, save that the same
sharp spasm passed once more over his face. "Well, I'm blessed!"
cried Hilary Joyce. "Of all the impudent scoundrels! He keeps on
winking at me. Who are you, you rascal? Give an account of yourself!
D'ye hear?" But the tall Arab was as impervious to English as
to Arabic. The Egyptian tried again and again. The prisoner looked
at Joyce with his inscrutable eyes, and occasionally twitched his face at
him, but never opened his mouth. The Bimbashi scratched his head in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mahomet Ali, we've got to get some sense out of this
fellow. You say there are no papers on him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; we found no papers."</p>

<p>"No clue of any kind?"</p>

<p>"He has come far, sir. A trotting camel does not die easily. He
has come from Dongola, at least."</p>

<p>"Well, we must get him to talk."</p>

<p>"It is possible that he is deaf and dumb."</p>

<p>"Not he. I never saw a man look more all there in my life."</p>

<p>"You might send him across to Assouan."</p>

<p>"And give some one else the credit? No, thank you. This is my
bird. But how are we going to get him to find his tongue?"</p>

<p>The Egyptian's dark eyes skirted the encampment and rested on
the cook's fire. "Perhaps," said he, "if the Bimbashi thought fit&mdash;&mdash;"
He looked at the prisoner and then at the burning wood.</p>

<p>"No, no; it wouldn't do. No, by Jove, that's going too far."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_036.png" width="550" height="132" alt="row of camels" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"A very little might do it."</p>

<p>"No, no. It's all very well here, but it would sound just awful if
ever it got as far as Fleet Street. But, I say," he whispered, "we might
frighten him a bit. There's no harm in that."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell them to undo the man's galabeeah. Order them to put a
horseshoe in the fire and make it red-hot." The prisoner watched the
proceedings with an air which had more of amusement than of uneasiness.
He never winced as the black sergeant approached with the
glowing shoe held upon two bayonets.</p>

<p>"Will you speak now?" asked the Bimbashi, savagely. The
prisoner smiled gently and stroked his beard.</p>

<p>"Oh, chuck the infernal thing away!" cried Joyce, jumping up in
a passion. "There's no use trying to bluff the fellow. He knows we
won't do it. But I <i>can</i> and I <i>will</i> flog him, and you can tell him from
me that if he hasn't found his tongue by to-morrow morning I'll take the
skin off his back as sure as my name's Joyce. Have you said all that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you can sleep upon it, you beauty, and a good night's rest
may it give you!" He adjourned the Court, and the prisoner, as
imperturbable as ever, was led away by the guard to his supper of rice
and water. Hilary Joyce was a kind-hearted man, and his own sleep
was considerably disturbed by the prospect of the punishment which he
must inflict next day. He had hopes that the mere sight of the koorbash
and the thongs might prevail over his prisoner's obstinacy. And
then, again, he thought how shocking it would be if the man proved to
be really dumb after all. The possibility shook him so that he had
almost determined by daybreak that he would send the stranger on
unhurt to Assouan. And yet what a tame conclusion it would be
to the incident! He lay upon his angareeb still debating it when
the question suddenly and effectively settled itself. Ali Mahomet
rushed into his tent.</p>

<p>"Sir," he cried, "the prisoner is gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and your own best riding camel as well. There is a slit
cut in the tent, and he got away unseen in the early morning."</p>

</div>


<p>The Bimbashi acted with all energy. Cavalry rode along every
track; scouts examined the soft sand of the wadys for signs of the
fugitive, but no trace was discovered. The man had utterly disappeared.
With a heavy heart, Hilary Joyce wrote an official report of the matter
and forwarded it to Assouan. Five days later there came a curt order
from the chief that he should report himself there. He feared the worst
from the stern soldier, who spared others as little as he spared himself.
And his worst forebodings were realised. Travel-stained and weary, he
reported himself one night at the general's quarters. Behind a table
piled with papers and strewn with maps the famous soldier and his
Chief of Intelligence were deep in plans and figures. Their greeting
was a cold one.</p>

</div>

<p>"I understand, Captain Joyce," said the general, "that you have
allowed a very important prisoner to slip through your fingers."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"No doubt. But that will not mend matters. Did you ascertain
anything about him before you lost him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"I could get nothing out of him, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you try?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I did what I could."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I threatened to use physical force."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said nothing."</p>

<p>"What was he like?"</p>

<p>"A tall man, sir. Rather a desperate character, I should think."</p>

<p>"Any way by which we could identify him?"</p>

<p>"A long black beard, sir. Grey eyes. And a nervous way of
twitching his face."</p>

<p>"Well, Captain Joyce," said the general, in his stern, inflexible
voice, "I cannot congratulate you upon your first exploit in the
Egyptian army. You are aware that every English officer in this force
is a picked man. I have the whole British army from which to draw.
It is necessary, therefore, that I should insist upon the very highest
efficiency. It would be unfair upon the others to pass over any obvious
want of zeal or intelligence. You are seconded from the Royal Mallows,
I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that your colonel will be glad to see you fulfilling
your regimental duties again." Hilary Joyce's heart was too heavy for
words. He was silent. "I will let you know my final decision to-morrow
morning." Joyce saluted and turned upon his heel.</p>

<p>"You can sleep upon that, you beauty, and a good night's rest
may it give you!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Joyce turned in bewilderment. Where had those words been used
before? Who was it who had used them? The general was standing
erect. Both he and the Chief of the Intelligence were laughing.
Joyce stared at the tall figure, the erect bearing, the inscrutable
grey eyes.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Captain Joyce, we are quits!" said the general,
holding out his hand. "You gave me a bad ten minutes with that
infernal red-hot horseshoe of yours. I've done as much for you. I
don't think we can spare you for the Royal Mallows just yet awhile."</p>

<p>"But, sir; but&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"The fewer questions the better, perhaps. But of course it must
seem rather amazing. I had a little private business with the Kabbabish.
It must be done in person. I did it, and came to your post in my
return. I kept on winking at you as a sign that I wanted a word with
you alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I begin to understand."</p>

<p>"I couldn't give it away before all those blacks, or where should I
have been the next time I used my false beard and Arab dress? You
put me in a very awkward position. But at last I had a word alone
with your Egyptian officer, who managed my escape all right."</p>

<p>"He! Mahomet Ali!"</p>

<p>"I ordered him to say nothing. I had a score to settle with you.
But we dine at eight, Captain Joyce. We live plainly here, but I think
I can do you a little better than you did me at Kurkur."</p>

<h2>THE ANT-LION</h2>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My</span> big and little readers, look at the picture illustrating this story and
tell me what you see. First of all, a hideous little monster. It has six
short legs and an enormous body&mdash;the sign of an insatiable appetite&mdash;and
carries on its head two sharp-pointed, curved, movable horns,
which open and shut like a savage pair of pincers. Suppose we were
to hear that, in a desert island, a monster like that, but the size of
a wolf, was just emerging from the thick jungle and making for a
traveller, for some modern Robinson Crusoe, and that, in another
moment, it would be sticking its tusks into him, how thrilling we should
find it! We should hope that the man whose life was in danger was
armed with the most effective weapons, which would help him to come
victorious out of the contest: a twelve-chambered revolver at least, to
say nothing of a breech-loading rifle and explosive bullets!</div>

<p>But we must not take an unfair advantage of the animal's ugly
appearance in order to provoke unnatural excitement, for what I am
about to tell is history and not a fairy-tale: proper, genuine history. I
will lose no time in saying that the creature is quite harmless to any of
us, even the smallest. By this I do not mean to suggest that it has not
a very fierce and brutal temper; only, the victims of its bloodthirsty
instincts move in a world so tiny that we tread it under foot unnoticed.
It is an ogre, ever hungering after fresh meat, like the famous ogre of
your fairy-tales: you know, the one who welcomed Hop-o'-my-Thumb
and his brothers to his house one evening, meaning to put them all in a
pie like so many pigeons; in short, just the sort of ogre who makes your
blood run cold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_045.png" width="300" height="212" alt="bug" />
</div>

<p>Our little monster, then, wants its dinner, a thing not always easy
to find in this world, especially for an ogre. Hunger is gnawing at its
inside; it must eat or die. Its usual prey is the Ant, a good runner,
whose nimble legs promptly take to flight and baffle the clumsy,
corpulent hunter's attempts to attack her. You might as well tell the
Tortoise to run and catch the Gazelle. Our ogre possesses no greater
agility in comparison with the Ant; and moreover there is another
reason that makes it quite impossible for him to run after anything:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
like the Crab, he can only really walk backwards, which is not exactly
the way to overtake your quarry when it's in front of you.</p>

<p>To be fat and heavy, to walk backwards and to be obliged to have
live Ant for one's dinner is a difficult, a very difficult problem. What
would you do in such a case? Come, try to find something! Rack your
brains! You can think of nothing? Well, never mind: plenty of
others, including myself, could not think of anything either.</p>

<p>Everyday common-sense, expressed in proverbs, tells us over and
over again that necessity is the mother of invention. This great truth,
which we have learnt by personal experience, we shall learn once more
from the Ant-hunter. But first let us give him a name, to simplify our
story. Naturalists call him the Ant-lion, a very happy term, which
reminds us that, like the Lion, he lives by carnage, slaughtering live
prey, in this case Ants. Now that we have christened him we can
go on.</p>

<p>When he wants his dinner, the Ant-lion says to himself:</p>

<p>"You're a fat little beggar, you know, short-legged and slow-moving;
you'll never catch Ants by running after them. On the other
hand, you can walk backwards, that's capital; you have a head flattened
like a navvy's shovel, that's first-rate; your pincers are long and grip
like a knife, that's perfect, absolutely perfect. We'll use that talent for
walking backwards; we'll use those tools, the shovel and tongs; we'll
make craft take the place of the agility which we lack; and the dinner
will come along."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. In a nice dry spot, warmed by the sun
and sheltered from the rain by an overhanging rock, the wily animal
selects a place where Ants are incessantly moving to and fro on household
matters. Gravely, with the mathematical accuracy of an engineer
tracing the foundation of a well-planned building, the Ant-lion walks
backwards, with his body dug into the sand; he turns and turns and
in this way hollows out a groove shaped like a perfect circle. Then,
still moving backwards and still digging deeper and deeper into the
sand, he repeats the circuit many times over, but gradually coming
nearer the centre, where he arrives in the end. If any obstacle, such as
a large bit of gravel, which would spoil the work, makes its appearance,
the Ant-lion takes it on his flat head and, with a vigorous jerk of his
neck, flings it to a distance over the edge of the hole. We should use
a shovel in exactly the same way to throw out the rubbish when
digging.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_045.png" width="300" height="212" alt="bug" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of this labour is a sort of funnel, two inches wide and
a little less in depth. For that matter, each Ant-lion scoops himself
out one proportioned to his size: the larger ones, the giants of the
family, produce one almost big enough to hold an orange; the younger
and smaller ones are content with a hollow which a walnut would fill.
But, whether great funnels or modest dents, all these cavities are
constructed on one and the same principle: the slope is very steep
and formed of extremely loose sand; nothing, however light, can set
foot upon it without producing a landslip, followed by a headlong fall.</p>

<p>When the work is finished, the scoundrel buries himself in the
sand, right at the bottom of the funnel; his pincers alone appear outside,
ever ready to snap, but nevertheless hidden as far as possible.
And now the Ant-lion remains completely motionless and waits; he
waits for hours, for days, for weeks, if necessary, for his patience is
unequalled; he waits for his dinner to come to him, as he cannot go
after his dinner himself.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="384" height="600" alt="Ant Lion painting" />
</div>

<p>Let us do as he does and wait, very attentively. What will
happen? See, an Ant comes trotting along, suspecting no harm,
bringing a little honey in her crop for her mates, who are working at
a distance, just as the goodwife, on the stroke of noon, brings the
reaper his midday meal in the fields. In her hurry, or perhaps in
her heedlessness, she has not seen the precipice. She steps upon it,
but only just on the edge. It makes no difference: as soon as her
foot is on the perfidious slope, the sand gives way and the poor thing
is dragged down. If our eyes were sharp enough, we should see signs
of fierce delight betrayed by the formidable jaws at the bottom.</p>

<p>Thank goodness! A microscopic bit of straw has interfered with
the landslide. The fall ends in the middle of the slope; and the Ant,
recovering her balance, tries to scramble back to the top. The sand
trickles under her feet; no matter: she goes to work with so much
prudence, she so skilfully makes use of the smallest solid support, she
is so careful to move sideways instead of going straight up the slope
that it looks as though the climb ought to be achieved without fresh
impediment. Her knees, her delicate feelers seem atremble with
excitement. One more effort, only a little effort, and the thing is
done. The edge is there, close by; the Ant must reach it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_045.png" width="300" height="212" alt="bug" />
</div>


<p>Alas, she does not reach it! Suddenly from the sky there falls
upon the poor wretch, thick as hailstones, a rain of grains of sand,
which, for the tiny Ant, is as bad as a regular rain of pebbles. Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
is the brute that takes delight in thus stoning the distressed Ant, who
clings in her despair now to this side, now to that, as best she may,
so as not to roll to the bottom of the precipice? The brute is the Ant-lion,
the ruffian, lying in ambush down in his funnel. See what he is
doing. He takes on his flat head a load, a shovelful of sand, and flings
it in the air towards the Ant, with a sudden, quick jerk of the neck, like
the movement of a spring. The shovelfuls follow rapidly, one after
the other. Whoosh! And whoosh! Do you want another? There's
one! You don't want another? There's one all the same!</p>

<p>What can the Ant do, I ask you, on the slope of that terrible
trap, where the ground falls from under her in a rushing torrent, while
a hail of pebbles dashes down from above? In vain she struggles, with
all the pluck of despair: for each step forward she takes three back,
coming nearer and nearer to the dreadful jaws that are waiting for her
at the bottom of the funnel. Bruised and dazed with the stoning, she
rolls over and over, right into the jaws. The jaws seize her and
everything disappears under the sand; not a trace remains of the recent
tragedy.</p>

<p>Peacefully buried in the sand of his lair, the Ant-lion devours his
astutely-captured prey. When the meal is over, there remains a dry
carcass, which must be thrown away, for, if left in the funnel, it might
frighten any game in future and betray the hunter in his ambush.
A jerk of the shovel, that is to say, a toss of the flat head, flings it
outside the hole.</p>

<p>Then the Ant-lion repairs the damage done to his trap, removes
the coarser grains of sand, touches up the slopes to make them ready
for a new slide. He buries himself as I have described and awaits the
coming of the next Ant.</p>

<p>That is how the Ant-lion secures his dinner. And yet there are
people who say that animals have no sense!</p>

<h2>AN ANGEL OF GOD</h2>

<div class='center'><i>A TRUE STORY</i><br />
<br />
BY ELLEN THORNEYCROFT FOWLER<br />
<br />
<span class='small'><i>Drawings by</i> STEVEN SPURRIER, R.I.</span><br /><br /></div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">You</span> may talk about the Germans as much as you like," remarked
Mrs. Batterby with her customary decision; "but, for my part, I have
no doubt that we shall beat them in the end: no doubt whatsoever!"</div>

<p>"Still, the German hosts are very numerous, and their artillery is
magnificent," said Mrs. Veale, who, much as she longed for the defeat
of Germany, longed for the defeat of Mrs. Batterby still more.</p>

<p>Little Miss Skipworth hastened, as usual, to thrust in the olive-branch.
"Dear Mrs. Batterby is thinking of the superior courage of
our brave English soldiers," she explained gently.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Batterby could not stand being Bowdlerised, or even
translated. "No, I wasn't, Matilda; at least not at that particular
minute, though nobody admires the courage of the British Army more
than I do, and always have done, and especially with Lord Kitchener
at their head and in action against the enemy. I've got a very
high opinion of the British soldier myself; none higher: much too
high, in fact, to allow him to wear a collar to his bed-jacket like
the one you are making, Matilda, without speaking a word in his
defence."</p>

<p>Matilda collapsed at once: she was composed of the most collapsible
material ever provided for the manufacture of souls. "What
is wrong with my collar, Mrs. Batterby? I thought I was exactly
copying the pattern sent to us by the Red Cross. Anyway, I was
trying to do so."</p>

<p>"Trying and succeeding are two different things, which I should
have thought you'd have found out by this time, Matilda, and you
five-and-forty, if you are a day! Give me the collar, and I'll fix it
for you, or else the wounded soldier that wears it will wish he had
died in the trenches before he had the chance of putting it on."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the afternoon of the Red Cross weekly working-party, held
in the village of Summerglade, in the early stages of the Great War.
The party was a small one, consisting of Mrs. Batterby, a farmer's
wife, in whose parlour the meeting was held; Mrs. Veale, the wife of
the village doctor; Mrs. Windybank, a gloomy widow; and Miss Skipworth,
an ingenuous and tender-hearted spinster. Between Mrs. Batterby
and Mrs. Veale there existed a bitter and abiding warfare.</p>

<p>"May I ask what you were thinking of&mdash;if not of the bravery of
our own dear soldiers&mdash;when you expressed your assurance of the
ultimate success of the Allied Forces?" asked Mrs. Veale, with her
needle in her fingers and the light of battle in her eye.</p>

<p>"By all means," replied Mrs. Batterby; "and, a civil question
demanding a civil answer, I don't mind telling you that I feel sure we
shall win, because we know that God is on our side and is fighting
for us."</p>

<p>"But their numbers are so great and their guns so magnificent,"
repeated Mrs. Windybank with a lugubrious sigh. "I sometimes fear
that they will win in the end, and we shall all be blown up by Zeppelins
and trampled underfoot. I'm sure I pray every morning that our
armies may win, but I tremble when I think of the forces against us."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i_050.png" width="425" height="222" alt="sewing basket" />
</div>

<p>"So did the Prophet's servant till his eyes were opened and he saw
the mountain full of horses and chariots," replied Mrs. Batterby. "But
some folk's eyes seem made not to open, like the stained-glass windows
in Summerglade Church."</p>

<p>"It is right to pray, but we must beware of presumptuousness in
our prayers," said Mrs. Veale sententiously.</p>

<p>"We'd much better beware of want of faith," retorted the hostess.</p>

<p>"But it is difficult to have faith when things seem going against us,"
said Matilda Skipworth.</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense, Matilda! It's when things seem going
against us that our faith is really any compliment to the Almighty.
I can't see anything very complimentary to Him when every morning
I pray with faith, 'Give us this day our daily bread,' knowing all the
time that it's in the larder with a damp cloth over it. But it's when
people pray that particular prayer, with no bread in the house and no
money to pay for any, that their faith is any compliment to God or
worthy of His acceptance."</p>


<p>"I know my faith is very feeble and my prayers are unworthy,"
sighed Miss Skipworth, "but I do try to
believe. Still, I cannot help envying the
Prophet's servant who <i>saw</i> the horses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the chariots fighting on his
side. I wish we could
<i>see</i> the angel hosts
fighting for us.
I do so wish
that we had
appearances of
that kind nowadays:
it would
make faith so
much easier and
life altogether
so much more
beautiful."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_051.png" width="500" height="306" alt="sewing circle" />
</div>

<p>"But it would not be in accordance with God's teaching in these later
times. Such assistance to faith as the appearance of saints and angels
would not be at all in accordance with our modern religious thought,
and I am sure that the Almighty would not permit it," said Mrs. Veale.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," retorted Mrs. Batterby. "I think that
visions of angels are granted to-day to those that have eyes to see them,
just as they were in Old Testament times."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mrs. Batterby," exclaimed Matilda in excitement, "do you
really believe that?"</p>

<p>"I do. But I don't believe that the angels appear as you would
expect them, Matilda&mdash;all got up in harps and crowns and flaming
swords. I believe that when they come nowadays they look so
commonplace and what you might call ordinary-looking, that only those
folks that have the eye of faith can perceive them at all. They can <i>see</i>
them all right, mind you! But they can't recognise them as the angels
of God."</p>

<p>"How I should like to see somebody who had actually seen an
angel!" sighed Miss Skipworth.</p>

<p>"Did you ever come across any one who had enjoyed such an
experience, Mrs. Batterby?" asked Mrs. Veale in a sceptical tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, Mrs. Veale&mdash;that is, if you can say that you ever came
across yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, how interesting!&mdash;how very interesting!" cried Miss Skipworth.
"But you don't look at all the sort of person that would see
angels and spirits."</p>

<p>Mrs. Batterby took the last remark as a compliment; as indeed it
was intended. "That's just my point, Matilda. The real angels don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
look like the Scripture-picture sort of angels; and they don't appear to
the high-flown, star-gazing sort of people who are always looking for
them."</p>

<p>"Do tell us what you saw, Mrs. Batterby," besought the emotional
Matilda.</p>

<p>"And also what calamity it foretold," added Mrs. Windybank.
"I always believe that supernatural appearances precede some terrible
misfortune."</p>

<p>"Well, my experience, or whatever you call it, happened five-and-thirty
years ago, and no calamity has happened to me since. On the
contrary, it taught me that no calamity <i>could</i> happen to me as long as
I lay safe in my Heavenly Father's Hand. That's just the lesson that
I learnt from it."</p>

<p>"Do tell us the story," urged Miss Skipworth.</p>

<p>"I will, Matilda, if you'll get on with your bed-jacket, and not
leave off your sewing whenever anybody speaks, as if your hearing
lay in your fingers, and you couldn't sew and listen at the same time.</p>

<p>"Well, when I was a young woman I lived with an aunt in
Merchester who kept a stationer's shop; and every Sunday I used to
walk over to see my mother who lived at a village about three miles
off, she being a widow and keeping the post-office there and my two
little sisters as well.</p>

<p>"It was one Sunday in September&mdash;one of those deceitful sort of
days that look like summer, and then take you all of a heap by getting
dark before you can say <i>Jack Robinson</i>&mdash;and I had been spending the
day with my mother as usual; I stayed for the evening service, it being
the Sunday-school Anniversary and a special preacher for the occasion;
quite a young man, but one of the finest preachers I ever heard.
Though it was five-and-thirty years ago, I remember that sermon as if
I'd heard it last Sunday."</p>

<p>"What was it about?" asked Mrs. Windybank. "For my part, I
always enjoy funeral-sermons the most; but I've heard some very
sweet ones in times of war, and on the last Sundays in the Old Year."</p>

<p>"It was on the very subject that Matilda was speaking about&mdash;in
fact, it was her conversation that recalled the whole incident to my
mind. The text was, 'Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God
met him'; and the preacher said&mdash;what I've just being saying to you&mdash;that
the angels of God meet us far oftener than we think; only we are
so busy looking out for them to come in our own particular way that
we don't recognise them. Unless they are in their flowing robes with
their harps and halos and fiery swords, we don't know that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
angels at all: which is just as stupid of us as if we didn't believe we'd
seen the Queen, unless we'd seen her with her crown on. I remember
that this impressed us very much: Queen Victoria had just been to
Merchester to lay the foundation-stone of some public building or other
(I forget what), and we had all cried at seeing her in a widow's bonnet;
it seemed to make her so much more real and human than if she'd had
her crown on. I'm sure that black bonnet brought her nearer to our
hearts than all the Crown Jewels out of the Tower of London could
have done; and taught us to love and reverence her as a woman as
well as obey and serve her as a Queen. And so, as the young minister
said, it ought to be with the angels; because when the Lord came
among us, He came as One of ourselves, and led us by the paths that
we were used to.</p>

<p>"Well, the sermon was so grand, and the hymn after the sermon
so beautiful&mdash;I remember it was a six-lines-eight, sung to the tune
called <i>Stella</i>, and mother and I swayed to it till we kept bumping
against each other&mdash;that by the time we got out of chapel it was
quite dark&mdash;so dark that mother didn't like the idea of my walking
to Merchester alone, as it was three miles at the least, and along a
very lonely road. But there was nobody to go with me, and I was
bound to get back to aunt's that night, for some special reason that
I forget now; so&mdash;like it or not like it&mdash;I had to go, though
I was very timid."</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadful! I should have been terrified,"
groaned Miss Skipworth. "I don't wonder that you
were frightened."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have minded if I'd been your age,
Matilda: surely a woman of five-and-forty is old enough
to go anywhere by herself! But I was only eighteen,
and that makes all the difference."</p>

<p>Matilda returned a soft answer&mdash;or, to be more
accurate, a soft question.</p>

<p>"Then did you venture, Mrs. Batterby?"</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i_053.png" width="342" height="500" alt="at the counter" />
</div>

<p>"Of course I did: there was nothing
else to do; and I didn't want mother to
know I was frightened for fear of worrying
her. But I didn't like it, I can tell
you; and I started with my heart in my
mouth, ready to jump at my own shadow.
And then it came into my mind (I
remember it as if it had happened last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
night) that I was a poor sort of Christian to enjoy a sermon and then
make no sort of effort to put it into practice; in fact, that I was only
a hearer of the Word, and not a doer, letting God's message go in
at one ear and out at the other, leaving nothing behind it. So I set
to to pray that as I went on my way the angels of God might meet
me, as they met Jacob, and save me from all harm. And what with
the excitement of the sermon, and my own fears, and the darkness of
the road, I got worked up to such a pitch that I shouldn't have been
surprised if a white-robed angel with shining wings had flown over the
hedge and perched beside me."</p>

<p>"Which, of course, no angel did," interrupted Mrs. Veale.</p>

<p>"That is as may be," retorted Mrs. Batterby darkly. "In the
middle of my prayer I heard a rustle in the hedge on the side of the
road, which, of course, I thought was a thief lying in wait to waylay
me and murder me, and I prayed harder and harder. But then, in the
fading light, I perceived that it was no thief, but a huge yellow collie
dog, such as they have for minding sheep."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said Miss Skipworth; "I should have been as much
afraid of a strange dog as of a strange man, if I'd been you."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, however, you weren't me, nor ever likely to be,
which seems fortunate for all parties concerned," replied her hostess
dryly. "And as for being afraid of a dog&mdash;why! I'd been accustomed
to dogs from a child, though I'm not the one to deny that collies are
uncertain in temper and apt to snap at strangers unawares. So I spoke
kindly to this one, in case it should take me for a thief come after its
master's sheep; though where the sheep were I hadn't a notion, there
being nothing but cornfields ready for cutting on both sides of the
road, the harvest being very late that year."</p>

<p>"It was rather foolish, to my thinking, to speak to it at all,"
remarked Mrs. Windybank. "I had a friend once who spoke to a
strange collie; and it bit her thimble finger so badly that she was never
able to sew properly again."</p>

<p>"Then she must have said the wrong thing to it," replied Mrs.
Batterby; "and it served her right. I know when folks say the wrong
thing to me, I'd give anything to be able to bite their thimble finger, and
dogs feel the same as we do. But to get on with my story. The dog
came up to me quite friendly-like, and didn't attempt to snap or anything;
but though it came close to me, it wouldn't let me touch or pet it. It
shied away the moment I put out my hand to fondle it. So&mdash;being
accustomed to dogs and their ways&mdash;I treated it as it evidently wished to
be treated, and just talked to it pleasantly as it trotted along by my side."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it followed you?" asked Miss Skipworth.</p>

<p>"Yes; all the way to Merchester, just as if it had been my own
dog. When there was nobody in sight, it ran backwards and forwards
and scampered about by itself; but whenever we met anybody&mdash;and we
met some nasty-looking tramps, I can tell you, that I should have been
terrified to meet alone&mdash;it came close to me, looking that big and fierce
that the tramps kept well to the other side of the road, as far away from
us as they could; and it stalked by me till they were out of sight, as is
the way of collies when they scent danger ahead. I can't tell you how
delighted I was to have found such a splendid pet; and I made up my
mind to take it home with me and keep it, unless some one claimed it;
as aunt and I had long wanted a house-dog to take care of the shop at
nights. And, besides, I thought it would be such a nice companion for
me on all the long country-walks which I was so fond of taking out of
shop-hours."</p>

<p>"And did any one ever come and claim it?" asked Miss Skipworth
with breathless interest.</p>

<p>"No; never. It followed me all the way to Merchester, wagging
its tail whenever I spoke to it, and looking up at me with its soft brown
eyes as friendly as never was; but it never let me touch it, though I
tried to pat it once or twice."</p>

<p>"And you took it home with you, the dear creature?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Batterby shook her head. "It followed me right into
Merchester; but when I was safe in the town among all the gas-lamps
and the people and the traffic, it turned round and scampered back
along the road by which we had come. I whistled to it to come back,
but it took no notice; and the last I saw of it was its yellow coat disappearing
into the darkness."</p>

<p>Miss Skipworth gave a deep sigh. "And you never saw it
again?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"And you never found out who it belonged to?"</p>

<p>A look came into Mrs. Batterby's eyes that was new to Miss
Skipworth. "I wouldn't say that. As a matter of fact, I believe I did
find out Who it belonged to."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was the sheep-dog of one of the neighbouring farmers,"
suggested Mrs. Veale.</p>

<p>"Some might suppose so; but I don't," replied Mrs. Batterby, still
with that wonderful smile in her sharp grey eyes. "For my part, I believe
it was one of the angels of God."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> came into the studio and, dropping on to a stool, said, as she drew
the pins from her hat:</div>

<p>"Dad, I've had an adventure."</p>

<p>She made the assertion with seeming gravity, but her father glanced
at her dancing eyes with a mixture of interest and a suspicion of being
spoofed; for past experiences of his light-hearted, mischief-loving
daughter had taught him to be wary; so he said nothing, but continued
to chalk in the rough sketch on the easel.</p>

<p>"Behold in me a heroine of romance!" said Kitty, striking an
attitude and regarding the toes of her dainty boots with her head on one
side; and her father, as he glanced at her again, noted vaguely her pose
and expression for future use; for Kitty served frequently as a model,
and her pretty face and svelte figure had appeared in numerous
magazines as the heroine of all sorts of stories.</p>

<p>"Father, I have saved a fellow creature's life," she went on. "Told
in the language of popular fiction it would run thus: 'A young girl of
pleasing appearance was seen going down one of our leading thoroughfares.
She was of meek and modest demeanour&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I thought you said the adventure happened to you, Kitty," said
Mr. Thorold.</p>

<p>"'The road was crowded with the carriages and motor-cars of
the wealthy and noble,'" continued Kitty, disregarding the mild
sarcasm; "'the young girl, lost "in maiden meditation, fancy-free," was
startled suddenly by a cry of anguished terror. Raising her downcast
eyes, she saw a pretty young thing running across the road right in
front of an approaching motor-car, from the occupant of which, a
lady of mature age and buxom form, the cry had arisen. Without
a thought of her own fair young life, the maiden rushed forward, seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the young thing in her arms and carried it in safety to the pavement.
The magnificent 2,000-h.p. motor-car pulled up beside her, and the richly
dressed lady, with a gasp of relief and admiration, expressed her appreciation
of the young girl's heroism, demanded her name and address, and,
handing her a card, desired the rescuer to call. The heroine, murmuring
something inaudible, blushed sweetly and, making her way through
the small but loudly cheering crowd which had collected, modestly
disappeared.'"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 157px;">
<img src="images/i_058.png" width="157" height="200" alt="dog" />
</div>

<p>"All very well," grumbled Mr. Thorold; "but you'll be brought
home on a stretcher some day, Kit. You're too venturesome by far.
What became of the child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't a child; it was a collie pup."</p>

<p>"I thought you said 'fellow-creature,'" remarked her father
plaintively.</p>

<p>"All dogs are my fellow-creatures," declared Kitty simply.</p>

<p>"I am a credulous as well as a sinfully indulgent parent," said
Mr. Thorold, stepping back to view his sketch; "but I don't believe
a word of your story."</p>

<p>"'Documentary evidence was instantly forthcoming,'" retorted
Kitty, extending a tiny paw with a card inserted delicately between her
fingers.</p>

<p>Her father took it, read aloud: "Lady Hawborough, 209, Belgrave
Square," and then emitted a low whistle.</p>

<p>"My word, Kitty, you've gone and done it!" he said. "If this is
<i>the</i> Lady Hawborough&mdash;and Nature, with all her audacity, cannot have
made two of them&mdash;you've run up against a celebrity of the deepest
dye."</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Kitty. "Never heard of her. What's she celebrated
for?"</p>

<p>"For good works&mdash;which means, in most cases, a disposition and a
capacity for interfering in the affairs of other people. And her ladyship
is one of the biggest and most incorrigible interferers in this crank of a
world of ours. She is immensely rich; she is also 'powerful,' as the
novelists say; she is a tyrant to her relations, a terror to her friends,
and a well-meaning, charitable bugbear to the world in general."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Kitty, somewhat dismayed. "But how is it you are
so intimately acquainted with the history and characteristics of this lady
of lofty rank and goodly oof?"</p>

<p>"My dear Kitty, 'oof' is not nearly such a good word as 'wealth.'"</p>


<p>"Maybe, but it's easier to pronounce," retorted Kitty.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Mr. Thorold, as if he were weary of the
subject. "Heard some one at the Club talking about her; seen her
name in the papers. Take my advice and don't call. She'll enlist you
in one of her gangs of workers, hustle you into a hospital as a nurse,
make you into a district visitor, or turn you a lecturer on vegetarianism
or some other fad."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/i_061.png" width="169" height="200" alt="dog" />
</div>

<p>"Oh no, she won't," said Kitty, with sublime confidence; "not that
I should object to being a nurse&mdash;that is, if I hadn't already to look
after an aged and infirm parent. Yes; much as I value your advice,
Dad, I think I'll call. I'll go to-morrow; and if I come back, say, in a
Salvation Army kit, and banging a tambourine&mdash;and, mind you! I
might do worse: I've a whole-hearted admiration for the S.A. and the
uniform is distinctly fetching&mdash;you can indulge in the exquisite pleasure
of exclaiming, 'I told you so!' What are you on this morning, Dad?"
she asked, going to him, putting her arm round his neck, and giving
him a little hug.</p>

<p>"Sketch for an illustration for the <i>Long Acre Magazine</i>," he said,
with a kind of resignation; for your most gifted artist has to do
pot-boilers nowadays: and generally he does them well.</p>

<p>"The girl's all right, anyhow," said Kitty. "Where's the man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to stick him in directly," said Mr. Thorold.
"He's to be a soldier, and I've got a young fellow coming as a model
presently. Ran against him in a rather extraordinary way. He called
on me yesterday with an introduction from Bloxham: said he had never
sat as model before; but that he was hard up, and would do his best.
Fine young fellow, and a nice taking sort of chap altogether."</p>

<p>"Burglar in disguise, coming to inspect the premises, no doubt,"
surmised Kitty cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Well, he's welcome to anything he takes a fancy to," remarked
Mr. Thorold.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" she said. "I'm off to consult Selinar-Ann as to
whether it's to be bread-and-butter pudding or a baked roly-poly;
expect me back, or what remains of me, in an hour."</p>

<p>Carefully rumpling her father's already disordered hair, she screwed
up his patient face between her hands, kissed him and ran out, singing
as she went.</p>

<p>In less than an hour she re-entered the studio, still singing; but
the song snapped off suddenly, and she stood just within the doorway,
staring with wide-open eyes at a young soldier in khaki who stood
on the model's dais, one arm in a sling, the other extended with
a sword in the hand, in the kind of attitude beloved by the populace,
and forming the picture which bears inevitably the legend, "Charge!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 139px;">
<img src="images/i_062.png" width="139" height="300" alt="woman at door" />
</div>

<p>The young man turned his eyes&mdash;he dared not move anything
else&mdash;and, at sight of the stricken maiden, his tanned face grew the
colour of a healthy beetroot.</p>

<p>"Getting on famously, Kit," remarked Mr. Thorold in a preoccupied
manner. "Arm a little higher, if you please, Captain&mdash;&mdash;Pardon,
didn't catch your name."</p>

<p>"Barnard," said the model, in a small voice quite inconsistent with
his fine and manly proportions.</p>

<p>"Ah, thank you! Could you&mdash;er&mdash;put on something of a scowl?
You're wounded, you know, and you're leading a forlorn hope, or
something of the sort."</p>

<p>The young man's good-looking face assumed as much of a scowl
as it was capable of doing, and Mr. Thorold dashed it on the paper.</p>

<p>"Capital! Now you can rest a minute. I've got to go and get
some more ochre. Perhaps you'd like a drink?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; I should," confessed the young man, with a slight
huskiness.</p>

<p>"All right; I'll bring it," said Mr. Thorold; and, as he was
leaving the room, he said over his shoulder, "My daughter; Captain
Barnard."</p>

<p>Kitty closed the door carefully; then, seating herself on the divan,
she rested her chin in her hand and, regarding the young man severely,
she demanded sternly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll be kind enough to inform me of the&mdash;the meaning
of this?"</p>

<p>He had seated himself on the edge of the dais and was wiping his
face, as if he were just going through a dangerous action, with the
enemy pressing on all sides.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" he faltered, with meekness in his voice, mien,
and eye.</p>

<p>"I asked you why you are masquerading here?" she said, uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>"Well, come to that, I'm not masquerading. This is my own kit;
I'm a soldier, as you know. This is a genuine wound, not a fake; and
I'm really hard up: had a run of bad luck lately. No harm in earning
an honest shilling."</p>

<p>"But why come to my father, this particular studio, to earn it?"
demanded Kitty, cutting short his feeble attempts at plausible
explanation.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he replied desperately: "you see, when I met you at
the Thomsons' the other night, and asked you if I might have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
honour of calling on you, you said that your father was a very busy man
and that you yourself had no time for receiving visitors."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 112px;">
<img src="images/i_063.png" width="112" height="300" alt="soldier with wounded arm" />
</div>

<p>"Well?" demanded Kitty, as icily as before.</p>

<p>"Well," he resumed, looking down and then up at her, as if he
could not keep his eyes from her face, stern and almost ferocious as it
was, "well, I asked the Thomsons who your father was, and when they
told me, I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;Well, don't you know, it seemed
to me that he might want a model. War pictures are all the go now,
aren't they? And so&mdash;&mdash;" He broke down, made a little gesture with
his unwounded arm, and blurted out, "Of course you know why I've
come. I wanted to see you again. I told you so the other night; like
my cheek, of course, but&mdash;I don't know how it is&mdash;I feel as if I'd <i>got</i> to
see you, to know you. Look here, Miss Kitty&mdash;I beg your pardon, all
the Thomsons call you that&mdash;I hope you won't mind my saying that
I've fallen in love with you?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me; I mind it very much," Kitty informed him with
distressing promptitude; but her eyes wavered and the colour came
into her face and made it, in the unfortunate young man's opinion,
more maddeningly fascinating than ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'm sorry," he said, but without much penitence in his
tone; "but the truth should always be told, shouldn't it? And it is
the truth."</p>

<p>"Is it?" queried Kitty. "You've seen me only once before, and
then only for an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Two hours and three-quarters," he said, as if he were a stickler
for accuracy; "and I fell in love with you after the first quarter of an
hour. That being the case&mdash;as it certainly is&mdash;what was I to do?
I shall have to go back to the regiment as soon as this old arm of mine
is right; and it's getting right quickly; and I felt that I couldn't go
without at any rate telling you what&mdash;what was the matter with me."</p>

<p>"You speak as if&mdash;as if love were a disease," said Kitty, with an
attempt at mockery which was an abject failure.</p>

<p>"So it is," he declared, "and I've got it bad&mdash;very bad indeed.
I'll ask you to believe me, Miss Kitty&mdash;I mean Miss Thorold&mdash;that I
haven't had you out of my mind for one moment since we parted."</p>

<p>"It's a pity you haven't something better to think of," said Kitty.</p>

<p>"There I disagree with you," observed the young man stoutly.
"I couldn't have anything better to think of, and I don't want to.
I shall think of you for the rest of my natural life. One moment,
Miss Kitty, before you refuse me. I ought to tell you that I'm a poor
young captain, in a marching regiment, with no prospects."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"The allurement is irresistible&mdash;&mdash;" began Kitty, with admirable
gravity.</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to hear it," he said. "So you accept me?"</p>

<p>"The politeness of a soldier should have compelled you to hear
me out. I was going to add, that it would be irresistible if I were in
love with you; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't go on, I beg of you!" he implored. "I'm not such a fat-headed
idiot as to suppose that you <i>are</i> in love with me. What I
wanted to ask you was to give me a show. You see, I've arranged with
Mr. Thorold to stand, not only for this picture, but for an oil-painting,
which I suppose&mdash;don't know much about art&mdash;will take some time."</p>

<p>"You have? Well, of all the&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Quite so," he said meekly. "You see, it will give me a chance
of trying to explain to you that, if you refuse me, it will be&mdash;oh, worse
than a conical bullet in a particularly vital spot. All I ask is that you
will look in now and again, and&mdash;and give me an opportunity of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bothering me to death," finished Kitty for him.</p>

<p>"No; bothering you into an engagement&mdash;which is sometimes
a serious affair, but not always fatal," he said frankly. "Come, Miss
Kitty, don't be hard on me! It's not much to ask&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it?" interjected Kitty with fine irony. "Thank you.
Captain Barnard."</p>

<p>"If you were in love with me&mdash;absurd idea, of course! but I'm
just putting the case&mdash;I'd come and sit with you and give you any
amount of chances."</p>

<p>Kitty heard her father's returning footsteps, and she stood up
and looked from side to side, and then at this meekly audacious young
man, with a mixture of astonishment and bewilderment&mdash;and something
else I cannot define&mdash;in her really wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the cool&mdash;&mdash;" she said again. But he cut her short.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he said breathlessly; "thank you ever so
much. Your father's coming. I'm to be here at eleven o'clock every
morning."</p>

<p>"And you think," said Kitty, as hurriedly, "that, by simply
sitting here and regarding you in that absurd attitude, I shall fall
in&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/i_064.png" width="173" height="300" alt="woman at door again" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, no; not at all. Fortune will have pity on me and give
me an opportunity for seeing you for a minute or two alone. Besides,
perhaps&mdash;I only say perhaps, mind!&mdash;you might be induced to lunch
at an A.B.C. shop," he jerked out in a rapid whisper, as the innocent
parent returned with his yellow ochre.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Kitty went up to her room, flung herself into a chair in her
favourite attitude, with her chin in her hands, and stared at nothing&mdash;no,
not nothing, but at the handsome face and manly form of a wounded
soldier.</p>

<p>Of course, she would not go near the studio while he was there.
Consequently, the next morning, at half-past eleven, she entered with
refreshment on a tray; and, with downcast eyes and a blush, informed
her father that she had left his soda-and-milk in the dining-room
because a change of scene and air would be good for him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/i_065.png" width="146" height="200" alt="woman with tray" />
</div>

<p>She was still rosy with shame when the model sprang from the
dais, caught her hand, and declared fervently that she was an angel.</p>

<p>"No, I am a sly and deceitful, not to say forward, girl," said Kitty.
"But I've only made an opportunity to tell you that I'm not coming
into the studio again while you're here."</p>

<p>"That's all right," he responded cheerfully. "Come in just about
this time. And I've found a jolly little A.B.C. shop where we can get
some lunch to-day: second turning to the right, in the corner&mdash;I should
like you to be able to tell me, quite quietly, why you find it necessary
to refuse me. I think that's only fair to you."</p>

<p>"And I think," said Kitty emphatically, "that you possess the
concentrated cheek&mdash;I am sorry there is no stronger word&mdash;of the whole
British Army; and I decline your invitation."</p>

<p>She kept him waiting at the A.B.C. shop for a good quarter of
an hour.</p>

<div class='center'>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</div>


<p>In the afternoon Kitty presented herself at 209, Belgrave Square,
and was shown into what a house-agent would call "the magnificent and
spacious salon." Lady Hawborough was seated in a capacious chair,
knitting for dear life; on a small table beside her was an orderly
disorder of blue books, reports of charitable societies, vegetarian tracts,
and the debris of her morning's correspondence. She received Kitty
with more than graciousness; for her ladyship, notwithstanding her
crankiness, was the owner of that organ the possession of which we are
led to believe atones for all minor faults, not to say crimes&mdash;a
"good heart."</p>

<p>Besides, she had been immensely taken with Kitty, and admired
genuinely the pluck and readiness which the girl had displayed in the
rescue of the puppy: of course, Lady Hawborough was a prominent
member of the S.P.C.A.</p>

<p>She gave Kitty some tea, patted her hand several times, and
proceeded to put her through a kindly, but searching, catechism; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
before tea was over, had obtained sufficient information respecting
Kitty's life to convince her that the girl was a fitting object of her
ladyship's benevolence. It is true that, every now and then, Kitty
caught a glimpse of the somewhat masterful spirit which her ladyship
displayed in her favourite occupation of ordering the lives of all who
came in contact with her; but Kitty was not so stupid as to fail to
recognise the presence of the aforesaid good heart, or not to credit the
old lady with the amiable intention which smiled behind the mask of
tyranny.</p>

</div>

<p>"She's not at all a bad sort," Kitty informed her father on her
return home. "Oh, I daresay she's fond of interfering and all that;
but she can't interfere with me; I'm not her relation&mdash;I was going to
say 'Thank goodness,' but I really do like her, Dad. She's coming to
see some of your pictures some day."</p>

<p>"Oh, my great aunt!" groaned Mr. Thorold, who, like a true
artist, had a loathing for the necessary, but sometimes maddening, art
patron.</p>

<p>The drawing for the <i>Long Acre Magazine</i> being duly finished,
Mr. Thorold began on the more important battle-piece.</p>

<p>"I think I'm going to make a hit with this, Kitty," he said to his
daughter one morning, as he was preparing for the arrival of his admirably
punctual and singularly patient model. "You see, I've got a splendid
young chap to stand for it. He's the real thing, instead of a coster
dressed up in an officer's uniform. And he's a pleasant chap, too," he
continued meditatively. "A modest, well-mannered young fellow: no
swank or swagger; in fact, a gentleman. By the way, Kitty, you
might remember that little fact, and not be quite so short and sharp
with him when he speaks to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, it won't hurt him," retorted Kitty, turning her back quickly.
"From what I have seen of him, I should say that Captain Barnard
would not be easily snubbed."</p>

<p>"And you try pretty hard," remarked her father. "For instance,
yesterday there was no occasion for you to tell him to shut up when he
observed that it was a fine day."</p>

<p>"All I said was that a model was much more effective when he
kept his mouth closed," said Kitty.</p>

<p>"That strikes me as being pretty much the same thing," said her
father. "He looked quite crushed."</p>

<p>"Do him good," murmured Kitty. "Besides, he can talk the hind
leg off an army mule when he likes."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked her parent, with mild surprise.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm only drawing inferences from&mdash;from his general appearance,"
said Kitty, looking a trifle confused.</p>

<p>"Going out to lunch again to-day?" demanded her father, repiningly,
as, clad in outdoor things, she passed him in the passage a
couple of hours later.</p>

<p>"Sorry, dear; got a pressing engagement. Besides, you never eat
anything. There! did it miss its nurse? Never mind! I'll be in all
the evening." She scrunched up his face, gave him what she called her
"screw" kiss, and departed to the A.B.C. shop.</p>

<p>By this time, it must be confessed, the fortress besieged by Captain
Barnard with such ingenuous strategy, but manly courage, had surrendered;
and to-day the wounded soldier had brought a pretty but
inexpensive ring with him.</p>

<p>"It's all I can afford, dearest," he said, as he slipped it on the
finger.</p>

<p>"It's a perfect duck," she returned, touching the ring with her
lips&mdash;a wicked and maddening thing to do; for you can't kiss a girl in
an A.B.C. shop, however much in love with her you may be.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow I'll tell your father. What&mdash;what do you think
he'll say, darling?"</p>

<p>"I know what he'll say, but I couldn't repeat it, because I've been
properly brought up," replied Kitty.</p>

<p>"But he won't refuse his consent, won't chuck me out?" cried her
lover, aghast.</p>

<p>"No; because, strange as it may seem, he's really fond of me. Oh,
I don't deserve it; for he's the dearest dad that ever had a hussy and a
minx for a daughter. No, he won't throw you out, at any rate until
the picture's finished. And perhaps you'll be tired of me&mdash;I mean,
I shall be tired of you&mdash;we shall be tired of each other, before that
time."</p>

<p>"I'll risk that," he said confidently, pressing her hand under the table.</p>

<p>That afternoon Kitty, in a state of perfect bliss, paid one of her
frequent visits to Lady Hawborough, with whom she had now become
great friends; in fact, the old lady had grown quite fond of the girl;
and the extent of this affection was proved that afternoon to Kitty by
an extraordinary mischance. The footman had shown her into a small
ante-room, which Lady Hawborough called her "study"; the adjoining
apartment was divided from that in which Kitty was waiting by a pair
of folding doors, and, one of these being partly open, Kitty heard the
rustling of dresses, followed by Lady Hawborough's clear and very
distinct voice saying:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Must you go, dear? I'm so sorry, because I wanted you to see
her. She's quite a nice girl&mdash;in fact, a really sweet little soul. Oh,
yes, of course, I've plans for her," she continued, as if in response to a
remark by the other lady. "I'm afraid she has not many opportunities;
the father is a struggling artist and they don't move in society, of
course. I'm thinking of&mdash;in fact, I've made up my mind to marry her
to Archibald."</p>

<p>"Lucky Archibald!" observed the other lady.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think he will be," assented Lady Hawborough, with a
complacency she always exhibited when disposing of the fate of those
belonging to her. "He is a good boy, a little wild, perhaps, but really
no harm in him; and it's time he was married. I'm a little anxious
about him, because he's so&mdash;so impetuous, like all the Hawboroughs."
Her ladyship's "dearest friend" could not have accused her of impetuosity;
and Kitty could almost see the other lady smile. "He is the
sort of boy who might fall in love with a barmaid or a ballet girl and
marry her."</p>

<p>"Then this young lady doesn't come within the category of
undesirables?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," said Lady Hawborough. "She's quite a lady and
will suit Archibald very nicely. I am very pleased with him; he has
been doing so well lately: quite distinguished himself; you've heard, of
course? It was in the papers. I am going to look after him."</p>

<p>Kitty had been listening with burning face and twitching lips. She
had been so astonished as to be incapable of carrying out her desire to
spring to the door and declare her presence, and escape from the position
of an eavesdropper; but she recovered sufficiently to rise and confront
Lady Hawborough as, on having said farewell to her visitor, she entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear!" said her ladyship, almost embarrassed, "I
didn't know that you were here: have you been waiting long?"</p>

<p>"Long enough to hear what you said," replied Kitty bluntly, her
face pale now, her eyes flashing. "I couldn't help listening. I'm sorry.
Yet it's just as well, because, Lady Hawborough, I don't think you
have any right to&mdash;to dispose of me in the way you intended doing.&mdash;I
don't know who 'Archibald' is."</p>

<p>"Archibald is my nephew," said Lady Hawborough stiffly; and
when Lady Hawborough was stiff, the common or kitchen poker
compared with her was a soft and flexible article. "My nephew and
heir. He is a very good and brave young man."</p>

<p>"He may be a saint for all I care," said Kitty; "but I don't want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to marry him, and I won't. In fact, I'm&mdash;&mdash;" She was going to say
"engaged," but she was really too angry to confide in Lady Hawborough
"&mdash;I'm resolved not to do so. I am afraid you will think me very
ungrateful, and that&mdash;well, that this is the end of our friendship."</p>

<p>"I think you are stating the situation very accurately," said Lady
Hawborough, whose face was exceeding red.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Kitty, rather wistfully and sadly, her resentment
waning; for the old lady had been very kind to her, and Kitty saw that
even this absurd intention of hers sprang from a benevolent desire
to benefit her protégée. "I want to thank you for all your goodness
to me, and&mdash;&mdash;Good-bye, Lady Hawborough."</p>

<p>She held out her hand, but Lady Hawborough appeared not to see
it, and Kitty got outside the "stately and desirable mansion" and
hastened home to enjoy a good cry.</p>

<p>When she made her appearance in the studio next morning, she
found her father seated on his stool in an attitude of profound dismay,
his long figure bowed, his rumpled hair clutched in his hands, his
painting-brush between his teeth.</p>

<p>On the dais stood the wounded soldier, his face flushed, an expression
of keen discomfort all over him.</p>

<p>"Here, look here, Kitty!" wailed her distracted parent. "Just
listen to what this young man's been telling me? He says that you
and he have got engaged! Heavens!"</p>

<p>"Quite true, father," said Kitty calmly, but with a blush.</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness! And he tells me that he's poor, and has
nothing to live on excepting his pay and a small allowance."</p>

<p>"That's true also, I believe, father," said Kitty. "I'm sorry;
but it can't be helped. You'll have to paint me as 'The Mendicant's
Bride.'"</p>

<p>"Don't joke about it, you foolish, abandoned girl!" groaned Mr.
Thorold.</p>

<p>"But you don't want me to cry about it, Dad dear," said Kitty,
going to him, taking the brush from between his teeth, and putting her
arm round his neck. "Haven't you got anything to say for yourself?"
she asked, addressing the discomfited young man.</p>

<p>"Not a word," he returned. "Said all I've got to say. And look
at the effect of it!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 167px;">
<img src="images/i_069.png" width="167" height="310" alt="artist" />
</div>

<p>"Yes," she retorted. "You've broken the heart of an affectionate
and devoted parent. You're a wicked young man.&mdash;Oh, dad dear,
do get up and go on with your work! You know as well as I do that
you're not going to make us unhappy? Say, 'Bless you, my children!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
like a good father, and let's all go up and mingle our tears over a lunch
at the Floriani."</p>

<p>"Ripping idea!" cried the infatuated lover, who would have said
the same if Kitty had proposed they should lunch in the moon.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Mr. Thorold, a trifle more cheerfully, and with a
shrug of resignation. "But I shall not go unavenged. Young man,
you do not know what lies before you. She will make a slave of you,
as she has made a slave of me; this girl is a tyrant of the most outrageous
kind. You will not possess a soul of your own; you will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bravo, Dad!" interrupted Kitty. "But it will be quite time
enough to give me away when we get to the church. There's your
hat, on the bust there."</p>

<p>"And now we'll go on the bust ourselves," said the young man
joyously. "I say, how jolly it all is! Would you mind my kissing
her, sir?"</p>

<p>He was in the middle of the somewhat lengthy act, when the
door opened, and Selinar-Ann announced in awe-stricken tones:</p>

<p>"Lidy 'Awborough!" And her ladyship swept in.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/i_070.png" width="118" height="300" alt="maid" />
</div>

<p>With his arm still round Kitty, her lover stared at the portly
dame as if she were a gorgon. Kitty, with a stifled exclamation of
astonishment, freed herself with difficulty from the young man's grasp,
and, with blushing face, hastened to greet the august visitor, whom
Mr. Thorold was regarding with an air of patient resignation.</p>

<p>But Lady Hawborough put out one hand to keep Kitty back,
and, fixing her lover with a stony stare, exclaimed sepulchrally:</p>

<p>"Archibald!"</p>

<p>There was a profound silence for a moment; then Kitty, staring
in her turn at her lover, echoed the objectionable word; for it was a
name she detested.</p>

<p>"Archibald! His name's Harry!"</p>

<p>"His name is <i>Archibald</i>," said Lady Hawborough sternly. "I
ought to know; for he is my nephew."</p>

<p>"Your nephew!" gasped Kitty.</p>

<p>The young man, having recovered from a fright which no shrapnel
built by Krupp could have caused him, now came forward with hand
extended.</p>

<p>"How are you, Aunt?&mdash;yes, it's my aunt, right enough. Didn't I
tell you? Must have forgotten to mention it: ought to be ashamed of
myself, for Aunt Philippa's been awfully good to me. Aunt, this young
lady is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know quite well enough who she is, Archibald," broke in Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Hawborough severely. "What I want to know is&mdash;What does this
mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" he stammered. "Oh, well, it means&mdash;of course, you
saw when you came in? It means that Kitty here&mdash;Miss Thorold,
allow me to introduce you to my aunt. Mr. Thorold, my aunt, Lady
Hawborough. Aunt Philippa, Mr. Thorold: he is the father of this
young lady, Kitty here, who has done me the very great honour of
promising to marry me. Sounds impossible; but it's true!"</p>

<p>Lady Hawborough stalked to the nearest chair and, with stately
dignity seated herself on it, very much as a judge might take his place
on the dreadful bench.</p>

<p>"Girl," she said, in her deepest tones, "why have you tricked,
deceived me?"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, as if influenced by a peculiar expression in Kitty's
eyes, an expression which conveyed a kind of warning, her ladyship
faltered, opened her lips once or twice, then said, in quite a different
tone, indeed, almost meekly:</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this is quite a surprise. You will forgive me if I am a little
upset. I think I ought to have been prepared. However, as you young
people have taken the matter into your own hands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just what we have done, haven't we, Kitty?" exclaimed her
lover, as if he were proclaiming the supernal wisdom of his relative.</p>

<p>"&mdash;there is no more to be said," concluded Lady Hawborough
rather lamely. "At least, I should like to have a word or two with
Miss&mdash;Miss Thorold&mdash;I mean, Kitty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Outside, Eliza!" cried Harry, otherwise Archibald, joyously, as,
catching the bewildered Mr. Thorold by the arm, he walked, almost
danced, him out.</p>

<p>Kitty did not wait for any question.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, explaining the significance of her warning
look, "it was just as well not to tell these foolish men everything.
It might happen that if Harry&mdash;I mean Archibald&mdash;knew that you
had meant to insist upon his marrying me&mdash;well, men get huffy so
quickly, don't they?&mdash;he might refuse to do so now."</p>

<p>"Well, he might, but I don't think it's very likely, my dear," said
Lady Hawborough; and she patted the little hand that lay on her
knee. "But I think you are right. We will not say anything about&mdash;yesterday.
You're a clever little thing," she added, kissing her.</p>

<p>"Can we come in?" demanded Harry, a few minutes later.
"Aunt, we're all going up to the Floriani to get some lunch. Come
with us, like a good soul!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"The&mdash;Flo&mdash;Floriani! <i>What</i> is it?" asked her ladyship fearsomely.</p>

<p>"It's a restaurant in Soho, where you get a thorough blow-out&mdash;I
mean a Continental lunch&mdash;for one-and-nine," her nephew informed
her. "Come on, Aunt Philippa!"</p>

<p>Lady Hawborough shuddered. "I should be delighted, Archibald
dear, but&mdash;but I think you'd better all go round to Belgrave Square with
me. It&mdash;it would be safer."</p>

<p>It was after lunch, when the two young and silly lovers were in
the very ante-room where Kitty had overheard Lady Hawborough's fell
designs, that Kitty, holding his head back from her for a moment, asked:</p>

<p>"But why does she call you Archibald?"</p>

<p>"Because it's my name, or one of 'em," he replied. "Harry
Archibald Stephen Fitzwilliam&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop, stop! I shall feel as if I were marrying half a dozen
men. But you haven't told me <i>why</i> she calls you Archibald; and has
thus caused all this confusion!"</p>

<p>"Oh, because a lawyer chap who bolted
with a lot of her money was called
Henry; and, moreover, a bishop we've
got in the family, and a chap my aunt's very
proud of, is called Archibald."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/i_072.png" width="161" height="400" alt="united couple" />
</div>

<p>"She'll have to drop that name,
Harry," said Kitty firmly. "I can't <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'abear'">bear</ins>
it. Do you think she will?"</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly certain she will, if
you've made up your mind she shall," he returned,
with an air of profound conviction;
"for it's plain to me you've captured the
aunt as well as the nephew. Yes, it's a
fair cop." "She's a dear," murmured
Kitty, very close to his ear.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> a preface to the story of the early life of
the late Allan Quatermain, known in Africa
as Macumazahn, which has recently been
published under the name of "Marie," Mr.
Curtis, the brother of Sir Henry Curtis, tells
of how he found a number of manuscripts
that were left by Mr. Quatermain in his house
in Yorkshire. Of these "Marie" was one, but
in addition to it and sundry other completed
stories, I, the Editor to whom it was directed that these manuscripts
should be handed for publication, have found a quantity of unclassified
notes and papers.</div>

<p>One of these notes&mdash;it is contained in a book, much soiled and worn,
that evidently its owner had carried about with him for years&mdash;reminds
me of a conversation I had with Mr. Quatermain long ago when I was
his guest in Yorkshire. The note itself is short; I think that he must
have jotted it down within an hour or two of the event to which it refers.
It runs thus:</p>

<p>"I wonder whether in the 'Land Beyond' any recognition is
granted for acts of great courage and unselfish devotion&mdash;a kind of
spiritual Victoria Cross. If so I think it ought to be accorded to that
poor old savage, Magepa, at least it would be if I had any voice in the
matter. Upon my word he has made me feel proud of humanity.
And yet he was nothing but a 'nigger,' as so many call the Kaffirs."</p>

<p>For a while I, the Editor, wondered to what this entry could allude.
Then of a sudden it all came back to me. I saw myself, as a young
man, seated in the hall of Quatermain's house one evening after dinner.
With me were Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good. We were smoking,
and the conversation had turned upon deeds of heroism. Each of us
detailed such acts as he could remember which had made the most
impression on him. When we had finished, old Allan said:</p>

<p>"With your leave I'll tell you a story of what I think was one of
the bravest things I ever saw. It happened at the beginning of the
Zulu war, when the troops were marching into Zululand. Now at that
time, as you know, I was turning an honest penny transport-riding for
Government, or rather for the military authorities. I hired them three
wagons with the necessary voorloopers and drivers, sixteen good salted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
oxen to each wagon, and myself in charge of the lot. They paid me&mdash;well,
never mind how much&mdash;I am rather ashamed to mention the
amount. I asked a good price for my wagons, or rather for the hire
of them, of a very well satisfied young gentleman in uniform who had
been exactly three weeks in the country, and, to my surprise, got it.
But when I went to those in command and warned them what would
happen if they persisted in their way of advance, then in their pride
they would not listen to the old hunter and transport-rider, but politely
bowed me out. If they had, there would have been no Isandhlwana
disaster."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/i_082.png" width="129" height="200" alt="man" />
</div>

<p>He brooded awhile, for, as I knew, this was a sore subject with
him, one of which he would rarely talk. Although he escaped himself,
Quatermain had lost friends on that fatal field. He went on:</p>

<p>To return to old Magepa. I had known him for many years. The
first time we met was in the battle of the Tugela. I was fighting for
the king's son, Umbelazi the Handsome, in the ranks of the Amawombe
regiment&mdash;I mean to write all that story, for it should not be lost.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Well, as I have told you before, the Amawombe were wiped out; of
the three thousand or so of them I think only about fifty remained
alive after they had annihilated the three of Cetewayo's regiments that
set upon them. But Magepa was one who survived.</p>

<p>I met him afterwards at old King Panda's kraal and recognised
him as having fought by my side. Whilst I was talking with him the
Prince Cetewayo came by; to me he was civil enough, for he knew
how I chanced to be in the battle, but he glared at Magepa, and said:</p>

<p>"Why, Macumazahn, is not this man one of the dogs with which
you tried to bite me by the Tugela not long ago? He must be a
cunning dog also, one who can run fast, for how comes it that he lives
to snarl when so many will never bark again? <i>Ow!</i> if I had my way
I would find a strip of hide to fit his neck."</p>

<p>"Not so," I answered; "he has the king's peace and he is a brave
man&mdash;braver than I am, anyway, Prince, seeing that I ran from the
ranks of the Amawombe, while he stood where he was."</p>

<p>"You mean that your horse ran, Macumazahn. Well, since you
like this dog, I will not hurt him"; and with a shrug he went his
way.</p>

<p>"Yet soon or late he will hurt me," said Magepa, when the Prince
had gone. "U'Cetewayo has a memory long as the shadow thrown by
a tree at sunset. Moreover, as he knows well, it is true that I ran,
Macumazahn, though not till all was finished and I could do no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
by standing still. You remember how, after we had eaten up the first
of Cetewayo's regiments, the second charged us and we ate that up
also. Well, in that fight I got a tap on the head from a kerry. It
struck me on my man's ring which I had just put on, for I think I was
the youngest soldier in that regiment of veterans. The ring saved me;
still, for a while I lost my mind and lay like one dead. When I found
it again the fight was over and Cetewayo's people were searching for our
wounded that they might kill them. Presently they found me and saw
that there was no hurt on me.</p>

<p>"'Here is one who shams dead like a stink-cat,' said a big fellow,
lifting his spear.</p>

<p>"Then it was that I sprang up and ran, I who was but just married
and desired to live. He struck at me, but I jumped over the spear, and
the others that they threw missed me. Then they began to hunt me,
but, Macumazahn, I, who am named 'The Buck' because I am swifter
of foot than any man in Zululand, outpaced them all and got
away safe."</p>

<p>"Well done, Magepa," I said. "Still, remember the saying of
your people, 'At last the strong swimmer goes with the stream and
the swift runner is run down.'"</p>

<p>"I know it, Macumazahn," he answered, with a nod, "and perhaps
in a day to come I shall know it better."</p>

<p>I took little heed of his words at the time, but more than thirty
years afterwards I remembered them.</p>

<p>Such was my first acquaintance with Magepa. Now, friends, I will
tell you how it was renewed at the time of the Zulu war.</p>

<p>As you know, I was attached to the centre column that advanced
into Zululand by Rorke's Drift on the Buffalo River. Before war was
declared, or at any rate before the advance began, while it might have
been and many thought it would be averted, I was employed transport-riding
goods to the little Rorke's Drift station, that which became so
famous afterwards, and incidentally in collecting what information I
could of Cetewayo's intentions. Hearing that there was a kraal a mile
or so the other side of the river, of which the people were said to be
very friendly to the English, I determined to visit it. You may think
this was rash, but I was so well known in Zululand, where for many
years, by special leave of the king, I was allowed to go whither I would
quite unmolested, that I felt no fear for myself so long as I went alone.</p>

<p>Accordingly one evening I crossed the drift and headed for a kloof
in which I was told the kraal stood. Ten minutes' ride brought me in
sight of it. It was not a large kraal; there may have been six or eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
huts and a cattle enclosure surrounded by the usual fence. The situation,
however, was very pretty, a knoll of rising ground backed by the wooded
slopes of the kloof. As I approached I saw women and children running
to the kraal to hide, and when I reached the gateway for some time no
one would come out to meet me. At length a small boy appeared who
informed me that the kraal was "empty as a gourd."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I answered; "still, go and tell the headman that
Macumazahn wishes to speak with him."</p>

<p>The boy departed, and presently I saw a face that seemed familiar
to me peeping round the gateway. After a careful inspection its owner
emerged.</p>

<p>He was a tall, thin man of indefinite age, perhaps between sixty
and seventy, with a finely-cut face, a little grey beard, kind eyes and
very well shaped hands and feet, the fingers, which twitched incessantly,
being remarkably long.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Macumazahn," he said. "I see you do not remember
me. Well, think of the battle of the Tugela, and of the last stand of
the Amawombe, and of a certain talk at the kraal of our Father-who-is-dead"
(that is, King Panda), "and of how he who sits in his place"
(he meant Cetewayo) "told you that if he had his way he would find a
hide rope to fit the neck of a certain one."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, "I know you now; you are Magepa the Buck. So
the Runner has not yet been run down."</p>

<p>"No, Macumazahn, not yet; but there is still time. I think that
many swift feet will be at work ere long."</p>

<p>"How have you prospered?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Well enough, Macumazahn, in all ways except one. I have
three wives, but my children have been few and are dead, except one
daughter, who is married and lives with me, for her husband, too, is
dead. He was killed by a buffalo, and she has not yet married again.
But enter and see."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 182px;">
<img src="images/i_081.png" width="182" height="250" alt="Baby" />
</div>


<p>So I went in and saw Magepa's wives, old women all of them.
Also, at his bidding, his daughter, whose name was Gita, brought me
some <i>maas</i>, or curdled milk, to drink. She was a well-formed woman,
very like her father, but sad-faced, perhaps with a prescience of evil
to come. Clinging to her finger was a beautiful boy of something
under two years of age, who, when he saw Magepa, ran to him and
threw his little arms about his legs. The old man lifted the child and
kissed him tenderly, saying:</p>

<p>"It is well that this toddler and I should love one another,
Macumazahn, seeing that he is the last of my race. All the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
children here are those of the people who have come to live in my
shadow."</p>

<p>"Where are their fathers?" I asked, patting the little boy (who,
his mother told me, was named Sinala) upon the cheek, an attention
that he resented.</p>

<p>"They have been called away on duty," answered Magepa shortly;
and I changed the subject.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/i_082.png" width="129" height="200" alt="man" />
</div>

<p>Then we began to talk about old times, and I asked him if he
had any oxen to sell, saying that this was my reason for visiting his
kraal.</p>

<p>"Nay, Macumazahn," he answered, in a meaning voice. "This year
all the cattle are the king's."</p>

<p>I nodded and replied that, as it was so, I had better be going;
whereon, as I half expected, Magepa announced that he would see me
safe to the drift. So I bade farewell to the wives and the widowed
daughter, and we started.</p>

<p>As soon as we were clear of the kraal Magepa began to open his
heart to me.</p>

<p>"Macumazahn," he said, looking up at me earnestly, for I was
mounted and he walked beside my horse, "there is to be war.
Cetewayo will not consent to the demands of the great White Chief
from the Cape"&mdash;he meant Sir Bartle Frere. "He will fight with the
English; only he will let them begin the fighting. He will draw them
on into Zululand and then overwhelm them with his <i>impis</i> and stamp
them flat, and eat them up; and I, who love the English, am very
sorry. Yes, it makes my heart bleed. If it were the Boers now,
I should be glad, for we Zulus hate the Boers; but the English we do
not hate; even Cetewayo likes them; still he will eat them up if
they attack him."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I answered; and then, as in duty bound, I proceeded to
get what I could out of him, and that was not a little. Of course,
however, I did not swallow it all, since I suspected that Magepa was
feeding me with news that he had been ordered to disseminate.</p>

<p>Presently we came to the mouth of the kloof in which the kraal
stood, and here, for greater convenience of conversation, we halted, for I
thought it as well that we should not be seen in close talk on the open
plain beyond. The path here, I should add, ran past a clump of green
bushes; I remember they bore a white flower that smelt sweet, and
were backed by some tall grass, elephant-grass I think it was, among
which grew mimosa trees.</p>

<p>"Magepa," I said, "if in truth there is to be fighting, why don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
you move over the river one night with your people and cattle, and get
into Natal?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 182px;">
<img src="images/i_081.png" width="182" height="250" alt="Baby" />
</div>


<p>"I would if I could, Macumazahn, who have no stomach for this
war against the English. But there I should not be safe, since presently
the king will come into Natal too, or send thirty thousand assegais
as his messengers. Then what will happen to those who have left
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you think that," I answered, "you had better stay where
you are."</p>

<p>"Also, Macumazahn, the husbands of those women at my kraal
have been called up to their regiments, and if their wives fled to
the English they would be killed. Again, the king has sent for nearly
all our cattle, 'to keep it safe.' He fears lest we Border Zulus might
join our people in Natal, and that is why he is keeping our cattle
'safe.'"</p>

<p>"Life is more than cattle, Magepa. At least you might come."</p>

<p>"What! And leave my people to be killed? Macumazahn, you
did not use to talk so. Still, hearken. Macumazahn, will you do me a
service? I will pay you well for it. I would get my daughter Gita
and my little grandson Sinala into safety. If I and my wives are wiped
out it does not matter, for we are old. But her I would save, and the
boy I would save, so that one may live who will remember my name.
Now, if I were to send them across the drift, say at the dawn, not
to-morrow, and not the next day, but the day after, would you receive
them into your wagon and deliver them safe to some place in Natal?
I have money hidden, fifty pieces of gold, and you may take half of
these and also half of the cattle if ever I live to get them back out of
the keeping of the king."</p>

<p>"Never mind about the money, and we will speak of the cattle
afterwards," I said. "I understand that you wish to send your daughter
and your little grandson out of danger, and I think you wise, very
wise. When once the advance begins, if there is an advance, who
knows what may happen? War is a rough game, Magepa. It is not
the custom of you black people to spare women and children, and
there will be Zulus fighting on our side as well as on yours; do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ow!</i> I understand, Macumazahn. I have known the face of war
and seen many a little one like my grandson Sinala assegaied upon his
mother's back."</p>

<p>"Very good. But if I do this for you, you must do something for
me. Say, Magepa, does Cetewayo <i>really</i> mean to fight, and if so, how?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Oh yes, I know all you have been telling me, but I want not words, but
truth from the heart."</p>

<p>"You ask secrets," said the old fellow, peering about him into the
gathering gloom. "Still, 'a spear for a spear and a shield for a shield,' as
our saying runs. I have spoken no lie. The king <i>does</i> mean to fight,
not because he wants to, but because the regiments swear that they will
wash their assegais, they who have never seen blood since that battle
of the Tugela in which we two played a part; and if he will not suffer it,
well, there are more of his race! Also he means to fight thus," and he
gave me some very useful information; that is, information which would
have been useful if those in authority had deigned to pay any attention
to it when I passed it on.</p>

<p>Just as he finished speaking I thought that I heard a sound in the
dense green bush behind us. It reminded me of the noise a man makes
when he tries to stifle a cough, and frightened me. For if we had been
overheard by a spy, Magepa was as good as dead, and the sooner I was
across the river the better.</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A bush buck, Macumazahn. There are lots of them about here."</p>

<p>Not being satisfied, though it is true that buck do cough like this,
I turned my horse to the bush, seeking an opening. Thereon something
crashed away and vanished into the long grass. In those shadows, of
course, I could not see what it was, but such light as remained glinted
on what might have been the polished tip of the horn of an antelope or&mdash;an
assegai.</p>

<p>"I told you it was a buck, Macumazahn," said Magepa. "Still, if
you smell danger, let us come away from the bush, though the orders
are that no white man is to be touched as yet."</p>

<p>Then, while we walked on towards the ford, he set out with great
detail, as Kaffirs do, the exact arrangements that he proposed to make
for the handing over of his daughter and her child into my care. I
remember that I asked him why he would not send her on the following
morning, instead of two mornings later. He answered because he
expected an outpost of scouts from one of the regiments at his kraal
that night, who would probably remain there over the morrow and
perhaps longer. While they were in the place it would be difficult for
him to send away Gita and her son without exciting suspicion.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/i_082.png" width="129" height="200" alt="man" />
</div>

<p>Near the drift we parted, and I returned to our provisional camp
and wrote a beautiful report of all that I had learned, of which report, I
may add, no one took the slightest notice.</p>

<p>I think it was the morning before that whereon I had arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to meet Gita and the little boy at the drift that just about dawn I
went down to the river for a wash. Having taken my dip I climbed
on to a flat rock to dress myself, and looked at the billows of beautiful,
pearly mist which hid the face of the water, and considered&mdash;I
almost said listened to&mdash;the great silence, for as yet no live thing
was stirring.</p>

<p>Ah! if I had known of the hideous sights and sounds that were
destined to be heard ere long in this same haunt of perfect peace! Indeed,
at that moment there came a kind of hint or premonition of them,
since suddenly through the utter quiet broke the blood-curdling wail
of a woman. It was followed by other wails and shouts, distant and
yet distinct. Then the silence fell again.</p>

<p>Now, thought I to myself, that noise might very well have come
from old Magepa's kraal; luckily, however, sounds are deceptive in
mist.</p>

<p>Well, the end of it was that I waited there till the sun rose.
The first thing on which its bright beams struck was a mighty column
of smoke rising to heaven from where Magepa's kraal had stood!</p>

<p>I went back to my wagons very sad, so sad that I could scarcely
eat my breakfast. While I walked I wondered hard whether the light
had glinted upon the tip of a buck's horn in that patch of green bush
with the sweet-smelling white flowers a night or two ago. Or had
it perchance fallen upon the point of the assegai of some spy who
was watching my movements! In that event yonder column of smoke
and the horrible cries which preceded it were easy to explain. For had
not Magepa and I talked secrets together, and in Zulu.</p>

<p>On the following morning at the dawn I attended at the drift in
the faint hope that Gita and her boy might arrive there as arranged.
But nobody came, which was not wonderful, seeing that Gita lay dead,
stabbed through and through, as I saw afterwards (she made a good
fight for the child), and that her spirit had gone to wherever go the
souls of the brave-hearted, be they white or black. Only on the farther
bank of the river I saw some Zulu scouts who seemed to know my
errand, for they called to me, asking mockingly where was the pretty
woman I had come to meet?</p>

<p>After that I tried to put the matter out of my head, which indeed
was full enough of other things, since now definite orders had arrived
as to the advance, and with these many troops and officers.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Then he lifted himself upon one arm, and
with the other saluted&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It was just then that the Zulus began to fire across the river at
such of our people as they saw upon the bank. At these they took
aim, and, as a result, hit nobody. A raw Kaffir with a rifle, in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
experience, is only dangerous when he aims at nothing, for then the
bullet looks after itself, and may catch you. To put a stop to this
nuisance a regiment of the friendly natives&mdash;there may have been
several hundred of them&mdash;was directed to cross the river and clear
the kloofs and rocks of the Zulu skirmishers who were hidden among
them. I watched them go off in fine style.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/i_082.png" width="129" height="200" alt="man" />
</div>

<p>Towards evening some one told me that our <i>impi</i>, as he grandiloquently
called it, was returning victorious. Having at the moment
nothing else to do, I walked down to the river at a point where the
water was deep and the banks were high. Here I climbed to the top
of a pile of boulders, whence with my field-glasses I could sweep a great
extent of plain which stretched away on the Zululand side till at length
it merged into hills and bush.</p>

<p>Presently I saw some of our natives marching homewards in a
scattered and disorganised fashion, but evidently very proud of themselves,
for they were waving their assegais and singing scraps of war-songs.
A few minutes later, a mile or more away, I caught sight of a
man running.</p>

<p>Watching him through the glasses I noted three things: first,
that he was tall; secondly, that he ran with extraordinary swiftness;
and, thirdly, that he had something tied upon his back. It was
evident, further, that he had good reason to run, since he was being
hunted by a number of our Kaffirs, of whom more and more continually
joined in the chase. From every side they poured down upon him,
trying to cut him off and kill him, for as they got nearer I could see
the assegais which they threw at him flash in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Very soon I understood that the man was running with a definite
object and to a definite point; he was trying to reach the river. I
thought the sight very pitiful, this one poor creature being hunted to
death by so many. Also I wondered why he did not free himself from
the bundle on his back, and came to the conclusion that he must be
a witch-doctor, and that the bundle contained his precious charms or
medicines.</p>

<p>This was while he was yet a long way off, but when he came
nearer, within three or four hundred yards, of a sudden I caught the
outline of his face against a good background, and knew it for that of
Magepa.</p>

<p>"My God!" I said to myself, "it is old Magepa the Buck, and the
bundle in the mat will be his grandson, Sinala!"</p>

<p>Yes, even then I felt certain that he was carrying the child upon
his back.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>What was I to do? It was impossible for me to cross the river at
that place, and long before I could get round by the ford all would be
finished. I stood up on my rock and shouted to those brutes of Kaffirs
to let the man alone. They were so excited that they did not hear
my words; at least, they swore afterwards that they thought I was
encouraging them to hunt him down.</p>

<p>But Magepa heard me. At that moment he seemed to be failing,
but the sight of me appeared to give him fresh strength. He gathered
himself together and leapt forward at a really surprising speed. Now
the river was not more than three hundred yards away from him, and
for the first two hundred of these he quite outdistanced his pursuers,
although they were most of them young men and comparatively fresh.
Then once more his strength began to fail.</p>

<p>Watching through the glasses I could see that his mouth was wide
open, and that there was red foam upon his lips. The burden on his
back was dragging him down. Once he lifted his hands as though to
loose it; then with a wild gesture let them fall again.</p>

<p>Two of the pursuers who had outpaced the others crept up to
him&mdash;lank, lean men of not more than thirty years of age. They had
stabbing spears in their hands, such as are used at close
quarters, and these of course they did not throw. One of
them gained a little on the other.</p>

<p>Now Magepa was not more than fifty yards from
the bank, with the first hunter about ten paces behind
him and coming up rapidly. Magepa glanced over his
shoulder and saw, then put out his last strength. For
forty yards he went like an arrow, running straight away
from his pursuers, until he was within a few feet of the
bank, when he stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>"He's done," I said, and, upon my word, if I had
a rifle in my hand I think I would have stopped one or
both of those bloodhounds and taken the consequences.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/i_091.png" width="412" height="450" alt="fire" />
</div>

<p>But, no! Just as the first man lifted his broad spear
to stab him through
the back on which the
bundle lay, Magepa
leapt up and wheeled
round to take the thrust
in his chest. Evidently
he did not wish to be
speared in the back&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a certain reason. He took it sure enough, for the assegai was
wrenched out of the hand of the striker. Still, as he was reeling backwards,
it did not go through Magepa, or perhaps it hit a bone. He
drew out the spear and threw it at the man, wounding him. Then he
staggered on, back and back, to the edge of the little cliff.</p>

<p>It was reached at last. With a cry of "Help me, Macumazahn!"
Magepa turned, and before the other man could spear him, leapt straight
into deep water. He rose. Yes, the brave old fellow rose and struck
out for the other bank, leaving a little line of red behind him.</p>

<p>I rushed, or rather sprang and rolled down to the edge of the
stream, to where a point of shingle ran out into the water. Along this
I clambered, and beyond it up to my middle. Now Magepa was
being swept past me. I caught his outstretched hand and pulled him
ashore.</p>

<p>"The boy!" he gasped; "the boy! Is he dead?"</p>

<p>I severed the lashings of the mat that had cut right into the old
fellow's shoulders. Inside of it was little Sinala, spluttering out water,
but very evidently alive and unhurt, for presently he set up a yell.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "he lives, and will live."</p>

<p>"Then all is well, Macumazahn." (<i>A pause.</i>) "It <i>was</i> a spy in
the bush, not a buck. He overheard our talk. The king's slayers
came. Gita held the door of the hut while I took the child, cut a hole
through the straw with my assegai, and crept out at the back. She was
full of spears before she died, but I got away with the boy. Till your
Kaffirs found me I lay hid in the bush, hoping to escape to Natal. Then
I ran for the river, and saw you on the further bank. <i>I</i> might have got
away, but that child is heavy." (<i>A pause.</i>) "Give him food, Macumazahn,
he must be hungry," (<i>A pause.</i>) "Farewell. That was a
good saying of yours&mdash;the swift runner is outrun at last. Ah! yet I
did not run in vain." (<i>Another pause, the last.</i>) Then he lifted himself
upon one arm and with the other saluted, first the boy Sinala and next
me, muttering, "Remember your promise, Macumazahn."</p>

<div class='center'>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</div>


<p>"That is how Magepa the Buck died. I never saw any one carrying
weight who could run quite so well as he," and Quatermain turned his
head away as though the memory of this incident affected him somewhat.</p>

<p>"What became of the child Sinala?" I asked presently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I sent him to an institution in Natal, and afterwards was
able to get some of his property back for him. I believe that he is
being trained as an interpreter."</p>

<h2>TRUE SPARTAN HEARTS</h2>

<div class='center'>BY<br />

BEATRICE HARRADEN<br />
<br />
<span class='small'><i>Painting and Decorations by</i> EDMUND DULAC</span></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/i_093b.png" width="102" height="125" alt="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">n</span> times of war the Spartan women used to say to their
husbands and sons, "Return with your shield, or on
it," meaning that they must either conquer or die.
There was no affection or indulgence shown towards
the warriors who survived a defeat; for loyalty to the
State was thought of more account than personal loss,
and he who had not died striking his last blow for
Sparta, was deemed unworthy of remembrance, and
could expect no mercy from those who had loved him and sent him to
the battlefield "to conquer or die."</div>

<p>So this was how the Spartans felt about their warriors; and you
can imagine their indignation as well as their dismay when, in the year
371 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, news reached Sparta that their army had been defeated at the
battle of Leuctra by the B&oelig;otians, a rival Grecian State, and that three
hundred men had saved their lives in flight. The news was brought at
the moment when some great festival was being celebrated in the city.
The <i>Ephors</i> commanded the names of the slain to be made known to
their relatives, and the women were forbidden to mourn. But the
mother of Eucrates could not at first hide her grief, and her neighbours
said among themselves:</p>

<p>"Why should she be sorrowful? Her son has died bravely. If
he had disgraced himself by flight, then only would she have the right
to mourn."</p>

<p>The old man Phidon came in to see her, and found her spinning,
busily engaged at her work, it is true, but with tears in her saddened
eyes. He was a very stern old man, a Spartan every inch of him, and
he spoke harshly to poor Ione.</p>

<p>"Ione," he said, "not one single tear should course down your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
cheeks, not one single pang of grief should assail your heart. I it is
who should weep. I it is who should mourn. For Callias, my grandson,
is not amongst the slain. Unlike your brave son Eucrates, my Callias
has not died at his post of duty. He lives, and by living he has brought
dishonour and shame on his family. How can I meet him? What
can I say to him? Nay, I will not look upon his face. I will not
vouchsafe one word of greeting to him. His father was the glory of
my life, but he is the soul of its shame. The gods have been cruel to
me in my old age; but they have been merciful to you, Ione. For
your son, death with honour. For my Callias, life with dishonour. His
father won the crown of wild olive in the Olympic games, and earned
the right of fighting by the king's side, and died there; and I was proud
of him. But woe is me that I cannot be proud of Callias."</p>

<p>And, Spartan mother as she truly was, Ione knew well that here
was a grief far greater than her own loss of her beloved son. She
brushed her last tear aside, and tried to comfort old Phidon, whom
she had known all her life. Her son Eucrates and this very Callias had
been friends together ever since they were children; and in the days
gone by, Phidon and Ione's father had fought side by side for Sparta.</p>

<p>"May be, Phidon," she said, "the gods have spared Callias and
his comrades, so that they may yet serve Sparta, and help her to
triumph over her enemies."</p>

<p>But he shook his head, and would hear no word of comfort, though,
as the days went by, it seemed to ease his stern spirit to sit beside her,
and watch her at her work. And then she would speak to him of
Callias, and urge him not to be over hard on the lad when he returned.</p>

<p>"You must pardon him, Phidon," she said. "Perchance he will
live to do great things for Sparta."</p>

<p>But the old man said proudly: "Nay, Ione, never a word will I
speak to Callias again."</p>

<p>And it was in vain that Ione pleaded for the friend of Eucrates,
always imploring the old man to believe that the gods in their wisdom
had preserved Callias for some splendid act of service and sacrifice yet
to come.</p>

<p>Full of these thoughts, and haunted by Phidon's unyielding
severity, she had a strange dream one night. She dreamed that King
Agesilaus was willing to pardon all those three hundred soldiers who
had fled from the field of Leuctra; but that Phidon interposed, and
standing in the Public Assembly, gave his vote against the pardon.</p>

<p>"My own grandson is one of the survivors," he cried. "Sparta
may pardon him, but <i>I</i> never will."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="495" height="600" alt="True Spartan Hearts Painted for Princess Mary's Gift Book
by Edmund Dulac" />
</div>

<p>The next day she told her dream to Phidon, and described to him
how with her mind's eye she had seen Callias standing lonely and
forsaken, the only one of the three hundred survivors who had been
spurned and unforgiven. His loneliness stabbed her to her heart,
more even than the loss of her son; and because there was no one else,
she had been impelled to stand by his side, to greet him, to encourage
him, to reassure him. And just as he lifted his head, bowed in grief and
shame, she awoke. When Phidon had heard her dream-story, his stern
heart was softened.</p>

<p>"I will not turn from Callias," he said. "It may be that you are
right, Ione. It may be that the gods will yet give him some great and
glorious chance. I will steel my heart to receive him."</p>

<p>So Ione triumphed at last. And truly her dream would seem to
have been some kind of divination, for, two or three days afterwards,
a decree was proposed by the king, and passed in the Assembly, to the
effect that all those who had fled from the field of Leuctra were
to be pardoned and received home without dishonour.</p>

<p>Ordinarily all survivors of a defeat were subject to penalties of
civil offence, and so this was quite an unusual proceeding; but no
doubt it was thought dangerous to take stern measures against such
a large number of Spartan citizens. Well, whatever the reason was,
there were many glad hearts in Sparta that day, and old Phidon himself
owned in secret to Ione that he longed to see Callias once more.</p>

<p>"For I must needs forgive him wholeheartedly," he said, "since
Sparta has forgiven him; but with my last breath I would tell you
and all the world that I would far, far rather he had fallen by the side
of the brave Eucrates. That would have been my glory."</p>

<p>As soon as news had come of the defeat of the Spartan army,
the whole remaining military force of Sparta was sent to the rescue,
and after some time returned to Sparta, bringing back the survivors
from the disastrous field of Leuctra.</p>

<p>Then Spartan hearts were softened, and mothers, wives, and sisters
stood waiting to greet those whom the gods had spared for further
service. But Ione sat at home spinning. There were no tears in her
eyes now, and her countenance was lit up by a calm pride. She had
learnt to be glad that she had no one to meet that day.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and Phidon came in. His manner
was strangely excited.</p>

<p>"Callias is not amongst us," he cried. "I have asked for him, and
no one knows. Could there have been some mistake, I wonder? Is
it possible that&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a><br /><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment there came a loud knock at the door, and Ione
opened it to Timotheus, a neighbour's son.</p>

<p>"Greetings to the mother of Eucrates," he said, as he stood before
Ione. "I am from Leuctra. I saw Eucrates fighting in the thickest
of the fray. I saw him fall; and there fell another by his side, fighting
as gallantly as he&mdash;his comrade in death as well as in life."</p>

<p>"And who was it that died with my brave son?" asked Ione,
whose hands were pressed together deep into her breast, and whose
face was ashen, though tearless.</p>

<p>"It was Callias," answered the young man. "Farewell, honoured
mother of Eucrates. I must go and seek Phidon to tell him."</p>

<p>But Phidon rose to his full height, and there was a smile of triumph
on his face and a new life in his bearing.</p>

<p>"Phidon has heard the news," he said, "and he thanks the gods for
this crowning mercy. For though in his inmost heart he would fain
have seen the face of his grandson once more, there was something
dearer to him than the face of Callias&mdash;it was the honour of Callias."</p>

<p>Then, turning to Ione, he said: "Now we can think of them together,
and share our pride in them, Ione."</p>

<p>For one fleeting moment Ione saw a vision of her young, fair son
falling before the foe, but her voice never faltered as she said: "Yes, we
can share our pride in them."</p>

<p>That was the true Spartan tribute to the heroes of Leuctra.</p>

<div class='center'>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</div>


<p>You see, the Spartans would not admit of despair in their lives;
they believed that while there was yet strength in the body, there must
needs be hope in the heart that the victory would be won. And so it
was the duty of a true Spartan to fight and conquer and live, or to die,
striving to conquer to the very last, with no thought of any possibility
of failure.</p>

<p>What do you think about this grand old Spartan code of honour?
Do you not think that we ourselves, each in our own way, young and
old, man and woman, boy and girl, may find something helpful in it to
bring to the service of our country?</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">You</span> boys and girls must picture a huge common, and four groups of
khaki-clad soldiers standing at attention in different parts of it. They
are about to be reviewed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Home
Forces.</div>

<p>The men had given up a great deal to come and join the Territorial
Forces, but it had not yet thoroughly dawned on them any more than
on the rest of England, how great was the crisis, and none of the
battalions had come out in sufficient strength to be sent out on foreign
service.</p>

<p>The inspection by the great General took a long time, and when
the order came for rank after rank to lie down, they did so with obvious
relief. At last the inspection was over, and all the battalions were
asked to converge on one point. At this point a waggon was placed,
and all the five thousand men lay down round it, the Generals and
their staffs lying behind it. It was a fine sight from the waggon to see
those five thousand fine fellows lying there in the light of the setting
sun, but was it possible to rouse them to see the country's urgent need?</p>

<p>I began by painting the beauty and the glory of England, the
loveliest place in the world, for you may go all over the world,
children, and you will never find anything so glorious or welcome on
your return as the white cliffs of Dover, and the railway run through

<p>But what touched them most was the thought of what England
stood for in the life of the world. It always has been, and always
will be, the <i>Home of Freedom</i>. Let a slave once reach a British
man-of-war&mdash;he is free. Britannia's daughters are
rallying to her now because she has given them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
<i>Freedom</i>, for they see that she is the champion in this war of the
Freedom of the World against a universal Tyranny.</p>

<p>Then I turned to what they themselves owed to England, their
homes, their faith, their security to work, their happy friendships, and
their love of wife, mother, and children. What they had not realised
up to now was that <i>all this was
in deadly peril for the first time
for a hundred years</i>!</p>

<p>One mistake of our Fleets,
one crushing defeat in France,
and the foe would be upon us;
the fate of Belgium would be
the fate of England!</p>

<p>What more glorious than
to follow the example of those
who had fought and died for
England?</p>

<p>In spite of the presence of
the Generals a great cheer broke
from the five thousand men
when I said, "I would rather
die than see England a German
province"; but finding that they
were allowed to cheer, as deep
a cheer followed the statement
that, if it came to the last
Waterloo, it was far better
to slip across the silver streak
and fight it on the other side
than let an invaders foot <i>for the first time for a thousand years</i> stain
our native land.</p>

<p>In the evening all the four battalions present volunteered for
foreign service, and as four more at the neighbouring Camp had volunteered
the day before in answer to a similar appeal, eight battalions
were added to the fighting strength abroad of the British Army.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">No</span>, no," said Colonel von Altrock abruptly. "It
is not always true."</div>

<p>The conversation died away at once, and every
one about that dinner table in the Rue St. Florentin
looked at him expectantly. He played nervously
with the stem of his wineglass for a few moments,
as though the complete silence distressed him. Then he resumed with
a more diffident air:</p>

<p>"War no doubt inspires noble actions and brings out great qualities
in men from whom you expected nothing. But there is another side
to it which becomes apparent, not at once, but after a few months of
campaigning. Your nerves get overstrained, fatigue and danger tell
their tale. You lose your manners, sometimes you degenerate into a
brute. I happen to know. Thirty years have passed since the siege
of Paris, yet even to-day there is no part of my life which I regret so
much as the hours between eleven and twelve o'clock of Christmas
night in the year 'seventy. I will tell you about it if you like, although
the story may make us late for the opera."</p>

<p>"It will not matter if we are a little late," said his hostess, the
Baroness Hammerstein, and her guests agreed with her.</p>

<p>"It is permitted to smoke?" asked the Colonel. For a moment
the flame of a match lit up and exaggerated the hollows and the lines
upon his lean, rugged face. Then, drawing in his chair to the table,
he told his story.</p>

<div class='center'>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</div>


<p>I was a lieutenant of the fifth company of the second battalion of
the 103rd Regiment, which belonged to the 23rd Infantry Division.
It is as well to be exact. That division was part of the 12th Army
Corps under the Crown Prince of Saxony, and in the month of
December formed the south-eastern segment of our circle about Paris.
On Christmas night I happened to be on duty at a forepost in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of Noisy-le-Grand. The Centigrade thermometer was down to twelve
degrees below zero, and our little wooden hut with the sloping roof,
which served us at once as kitchen, mess-room, and dormitory, seemed
to us all a comfortable shelter. Outside its door the country glimmered
away into darkness, a great white silent plain of snow. Inside, the
camp-bedsteads were neatly ranged along the wall where the roof was
lowest. A long table covered with a white cloth&mdash;for we were luxurious
on Christmas night&mdash;occupied the middle of the floor; in a corner stood
a fine big barrel of Bavarian beer which had arrived that morning as a
Christmas present from my mother at Leipzig. We were none of us
anxious to turn out into the bitter cold, I can tell you. But we were
not colonels in those days, and while the Hauptmann was proposing my
mother's health the door was thrust open and an orderly muffled up to
the eyes stood on the threshold at the salute.</p>

<p>"The Herr Oberst wishes to see the Herr Lieutenant von Altrock,"
said he, and before I had time even to grumble he turned on his heels
and marched away.</p>

<p>I took down my great-coat, drew the cape over my head, and went
out of the hut. There was no wind, nor was the snow falling, but the
cold was terrible, and to me who had come straight from the noise of
my companions the night seemed unnaturally still. I plodded away
through the darkness. Behind me in the hut the Hauptmann struck
up a song, and the words came to me quite clearly and very plaintively
across the snow:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Ich hatte einen Kamaraden<br />
Einen besseren findest du nicht.<br />
</div>

<p>I wondered whether in the morning, like that comrade, I should
be a man to be mentioned in the past tense. For more than once a
sentinel had been found frozen dead at his post, and I foresaw
a long night's work before me. My Colonel had acquired a
habit of choosing me for special services, and indeed to his
kindness in this respect I owed my commission.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 189px;">

</div>

<p>I found him sitting at a little table drawn close to the fire
in a bare, dimly-lighted room. A lamp stood on the table, and
he was peering at a crumpled scrap of paper and smoothing
out its creases. So engrossed was he, indeed, in his scrutiny
that it was some minutes before he raised his head and saw me
waiting for his commands.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant von Altrock," he said, "you must ride to
Raincy."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Raincy was only five miles distant, as the crow flies. Yes, but the
French had made a sortie on the 21st, they had pushed back our lines,
and they now held Ville Evrart and Maison Blanche between Raincy
and Noisy-le-Grand. I should have to make a circuit; my five miles
became ten. I did not like the prospect at all. I liked it still less
when the Colonel added:</p>

<p>"You must be careful. More than one German soldier has of late
been killed upon that road. There are <i>francs-tireurs</i> about. And you
<i>must</i> reach Raincy."</p>

<p>It was a verbal message which he gave me, and I was to deliver
it in person to the commandant of the battery at Raincy.</p>

<p>"There is a horse ready for you at the stables," said the Colonel,
and with a nod he turned again to his scrap of paper. I saluted
and walked to the door. As my hand was on the knob he called
me back.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" he asked, holding the paper out to
me. "It was picked out of the Marne in a sealed wine-bottle."</p>

<p>I took the paper, and saw that a single sentence was written upon
it in a round and laborious hand with the words misspelt. The
meaning of the sentence seemed simple enough. It was apparently a
message from a M. Bonnet to his son in the Mobiles at Paris, and it
stated that the big black cat had had five kittens.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" repeated the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Why, that M. Bonnet's black cat has kittens," said I.</p>

<p>I handed the paper back. The Colonel looked at it again, shrugged
his shoulders, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, after all, perhaps it does mean no more than that," said he.</p>

<p>But for the Colonel's suspicions I should not have given another
thought to that misspelt scrawl. M. Bonnet was probably some little
peasant engrossed in domestic affairs, who thought that no message
could be more consoling to his son locked up in Paris than this great
news about the black cat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/i_107.png" width="325" height="400" alt="man at desk" />
</div>

<p>The wildest rumours were flying about our camp at that time, as I
think will always happen when you have a large body of men living
under a great strain of cold and privation and
peril. They perplexed the seasoned officers and
they were readily swallowed by the youngsters,
of whom I was one. Now, this scrap of paper
happened to fit in with the rumour which most
of all exercised our imaginations.</p>

<p>It was known that in spite of all our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
precautions news was continually leaking into Paris which we did not
think it good for the Parisians to have. On that very Christmas Day
they already knew that General Faidherbe, at Pont Noyelles, had
repulsed a portion of our first army under General Manteuffel. How
did they know? We were not satisfied that pigeons and balloons
completely explained the mystery. No, we believed that the news
passed somewhere through our lines on the south-east of Paris&mdash;news
in cipher which was passed on and on to a house close to our lines,
whence, as occasion served, it was carried into Paris.</p>

<p>That was the rumour. There may have been truth in it, or it
may have been entirely false. But, at all events, it had just the
necessary element of fancy to appeal to the imagination of a very young
man, and as I walked to the stables and mounted the horse which the
Colonel had lent me, I kept wondering whether this message, so simple
in appearance, had travelled so, and was covering its last stage between
the undiscovered château and Paris in the sealed wine-bottle. I tried
to make out what the black cat stood for in the cipher, and whose
identity was concealed under the pseudonym of M. Bonnet. So I rode
down the slope of Noisy-le-Grand.</p>

<p>But at the bottom of the slope these speculations passed entirely
from my mind. In front, hidden away in the darkness, lay the dangers
of Ville Evrart and Maison Blanche. German soldiers had ridden along
this path and had not returned; the <i>francs-tireurs</i> were abroad. Yet
I must reach Raincy. Moreover, in my own mind, I was equally convinced
that I must return. I saw the little beds against the wall of the
hut under the sloping roof. I rode warily, determined to sleep in one
of them that night, determined to keep my life if it could be kept.</p>

<p>I crossed the Marne and turned off the road into a forest path.
Ville Evrart with its French garrison lay now upon my left behind the
screen of trees. Fortunately there was no moon that night and a mist
hung in the air. The snow, too, deadened the sound of my horse's
hoofs. But I rode, nevertheless, very gently and with every
sense alert. Each moment I expected the challenge of a
sentinel in French.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i_108.png" width="321" height="400" alt="soldier on horseback" />
</div>

<p>I came to the end of the wood and rode
on to Chesnay. Here the country was more
open, and I had passed Ville Evrart. But I
did not feel any greater security. I was
possessed with a sort of rage to get my business
done and live&mdash;yes, at all costs <i>live</i>. A
mile beyond Chesnay I came to cross-roads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and within the angle which the two roads made a little cabin stood upon
a plot of grass. I was in doubt which road to take. The cabin was all
dark, and riding up to the door I hammered upon it with the butt of
my pistol. It was not immediately opened. There must indeed have
been some delay, since the inmates were evidently in bed. But I was
not in any mood to show consideration. I wanted to get on&mdash;to get
on and live. A little window was within my reach. I dashed the butt
of the pistol violently through the glass.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 172px;">
<img src="images/i_109.png" width="172" height="400" alt="woman" />
</div>

<p>"Will that waken you, eh?" I cried, and almost before I had
finished I heard a shuffling footstep in the passage and the door was
opened. A poor old peasant-woman, crippled with rheumatism, stood
in the doorway shading a lighted candle with a gnarled, trembling hand.
In her haste to obey she had merely thrown a petticoat over the
shoulders of her nightdress, and there she stood with bare feet, shivering
in the cold, an old bent woman of eighty, and apologised.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, monsieur," she said meekly. "But I cannot move as
quickly as I could when I was young. How can I serve monsieur?"</p>

<p>Not a word of reproach about her broken window. You would
think that the hardest man must have felt some remorse. I merely
broke in upon her apologies with a rough demand for information.</p>

<p>"The road upon your right leads to Chelles, monsieur," she
answered. "That upon your left to Raincy."</p>

<p>I rode off without another word. It is not a pretty description
which I am giving to you, but it is a true one. That is my regret, it is
a true one. I forgot that old peasant-woman the moment I had passed
the cabin. I thought only of the long avenues of trees which stretched
across that flat country, and which could hide whole companies of
<i>francs-tireurs</i>. I strained my eyes forwards. I listened for the sound
of voices. But the first voice which I heard spoke in my own tongue.</p>

<p>It was the voice of a sentry on the outposts of Raincy, and I could
have climbed down from my saddle and hugged him to my heart.
Instead, I sat impassively in my saddle and gave him the countersign.
I was conducted to the quarters of the commandant of artillery and I
delivered my message.</p>

<p>"You have come quickly," he said. "What road did you take?"</p>

<p>"That of Chesnay and Gagny."</p>

<p>The commandant looked queerly at me.</p>

<p>"Did you?" said he. "You are lucky. You will return by
Montfermeil and Chelles, Lieutenant von Altrock, and I will send
an escort with you. Apparently we are better informed at Raincy
than you at Noisy-le-Grand."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew there was danger, sir," I
replied.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/i_110.png" width="337" height="400" alt="soldier on horseback at window" />
</div>

<p>A regiment of dragoons was quartered
at Raincy, and from it two privates and
a corporal were given me for escort. In
the company of these men I started back
by the longer road in the rear of our lines.
And it was a quarter to ten when I started.
For I noticed the time of a clock in the
commandant's quarters. I should think
that it must have taken three-quarters of
an hour to reach Montfermeil, for the snow
was deep here and the mist very thick.
Beyond Montfermeil, however, we came
to higher ground; there were fewer drifts of snow, and the night
began to clear, so that we made better going. We were now, of course,
behind our lines, and the only risk we ran was that a few peasants
armed with rifles from a battlefield or a small band of <i>francs-tireurs</i>
might be lurking on the chance of picking off a straggler. But that
risk was not very great now that there were four of us. I rode therefore
with an easier mind, and the first thing which entered my thoughts
was&mdash;what do you think? The old peasant-woman's cabin with the
broken window? Not a bit of it. No, it was M. Bonnet's black cat.
Had M. Bonnet's cat five kittens? Or was that intended to inform
the people in Paris how many companies of recruits had joined one
of the French armies still in the field&mdash;say, General Faidherbe's, at
Bapaume, and so to keep up their spirits and prolong the siege? I
was still puzzling over this problem when in a most solitary place I
came suddenly upon a château with lighted windows. This was the
Château Villetaneuse. I reined in my horse and stopped. My escort
halted behind me. It was, after all, an astonishing sight. There
were many châteaux about Paris then, as there are now, but not one
that I had ever come across was inhabited by more than a caretaker.
The owners had long since fled. Breached walls, trampled gardens,
gaping roofs, and silence and desertion&mdash;that is what we meant when
we spoke of a château near Paris in those days. But here was one
with lighted windows on the first and second stories staring out calmly
on the snow as though never a Prussian soldier had crossed the Rhine.
A thick clump of trees sheltered it behind, and it faced the eastern
side of the long ridge of Mont Guichet, along the foot of which I rode&mdash;the
side farthest from Paris. From the spot where I and my escort
had halted an open park stretched level to the door. The house had,
no doubt, a very homelike look on that cold night. It should have
spoken to me, no doubt, of the well-ordered family life and the gentle
occupations of women. But I was thinking of M. Bonnet's black cat.
Was this solitary château the undiscovered last station on the underground
road through which the news passed into Paris? If not, why was
it still inhabited? Why did the lights blaze out upon the snow so late?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="389" height="600" alt="woman with lantern painting" />
</div>

<p>I commanded my escort to be silent. We rode across the park,
and half-way to the door we came upon a wire fence and a gate. There
we dismounted, and walked our horses. We tethered them to a tree
about twenty yards from the house. I ordered one of my dragoons to
go round the house, and watch any door which he might find at the
back. I told the other two to stay where they were, and I advanced
alone to the steps, but before I had reached them the front door was
thrown open, and a girl with a lantern in her hand came out.</p>

<p>She held the lantern high above her head and peered forward, so
that the light fell full upon her hair, her face, and dress. She was
a tall girl and slight of figure, with big, dark eyes, and a face pretty and
made for laughter. It was very pale now, however, and the brows
were drawn together in a frown. She wore a white evening frock,
which glistened in the lantern light, and over her bare shoulders she
had flung a heavy black military cloak. So she stood and swung the
lantern slowly from side to side as she stared into the darkness, while
the lights and shadows chased each other swiftly across her white frock,
her anxious face, and the waves of her fair hair.</p>

<p>"Whom do you expect at this hour, mademoiselle?" I asked.</p>

<p>I was quite close to her, but she had not seen me, for I stood at
the bottom of the steps, and she was looking out over my head. Yet
she did not start or utter any cry. Only the lantern rattled in her
hand. Then she stood quite still for a moment or two, and afterwards
lowered her arm until the light shone upon me.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 206px;">
<img src="images/i_113.png" width="206" height="400" alt="woman with lantern" />
</div>

<p>"You are Prussian?" she said.</p>

<p>"A lieutenant of foot," I answered. "You have nothing
to fear."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she replied quietly.</p>

<p>"Whom do you expect?"</p>

<p>"No one," she replied. "I thought that I heard the rattle
of iron as though a horse moved and a stirrup rang. It is lonely
here since our neighbours have fled. I came out to see."</p>

<p>"The lantern then, was not a signal, mademoiselle?" I
asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a><br /><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at me in perplexity, and certainly the little piece of
acting, I thought, was very well done.</p>

<p>"A signal?" she repeated. "To whom?"</p>

<p>"To some man hiding in the woods of Mont Guichet, a signal to
him that he may come and fetch the news for Paris which has lately&mdash;very
lately&mdash;been brought to the house."</p>

<p>She bent forward and peered down at me, drawing the cloak closer
about her neck.</p>

<p>"You are under some strange mistake, monsieur," she said. "No
news for Paris has been brought to this house by any one."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" I answered. "And is that so?" Then I stretched
out my hand and said triumphantly: "You will tell me perhaps that
the cloak upon your shoulders is a woman's cloak?"</p>

<p>And she laughed! It was humiliating; it is always humiliating
to a young man not to be taken seriously, isn't it? There was I thinking
that I had fairly cross-examined her into a trap, and she laughed
indulgently. And she explained indulgently, too.</p>

<p>"The cloak I am wearing belongs to a wounded French officer who
was taken prisoner and released upon parole. He is now in our house."</p>

<p>"Then I think I will make his acquaintance," I said, and over my
shoulder I called to the corporal. As he advanced to my side, a look
of alarm came into the girl's face.</p>

<p>"You are not alone," she said, and suddenly her face became
wistful and her voice began to plead. "You have not come for him?
He has done no harm. He could not, even if he would. And he
would not, for he has given his parole. Oh, you are not going to take
him away?"</p>

<p>"That we shall see, mademoiselle."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/i_114.png" width="256" height="400" alt="woman" />
</div>

<p>I left one dragoon at the door. I ordered the corporal to wait in the
hall, and I followed the girl up the stairs to the first floor. All her pride
had gone; she led the way with a submission of manner which seemed
to me only a fresh effort to quiet my suspicions. But they were not
quieted. I distrusted her; I believed that I had under my fingers the
proof of that rumour which flew about our camp. She stopped at a
door, and as she turned the handle she said:</p>

<p>"This is my own room, monsieur. We all use it now, for it is
warmer than the others, and all our servants but one have fled."</p>

<p>It was a pretty room, and cheery enough to one who came into it
from the darkness and the snow. A piano stood open in a corner with
a rug thrown upon it to protect the strings from the cold; books lay
upon the tables, heavy curtains were drawn close over the windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
there were cushioned sofas and deep arm-chairs, and a good fire of logs
blazed upon the hearth. These details I took in at once. Then I looked
at the occupants. A young man lay stretched upon a sofa close to the fire
with a wrap covering his legs. The wrap was raised by a cradle to keep
off its weight. His face must have been, I think, unusually handsome
when he had his health; at the moment it was so worn and pale, and
the eyes were so sunk, that all its beauty had gone. The pallor was
accentuated by a small black moustache he wore and his black hair.
He lay with his head supported upon a pillow, and was playing a
game of chess with an old lady who sat at a little table by his side.
I advanced to the fire and warmed my hands at it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_115.png" width="400" height="277" alt="man lying on chaise" />
</div>

<p>"You, sir, are the wounded officer on parole?" I said in French.
The officer bowed.</p>

<p>"And you, madame?" I asked of the old lady. The sight of my
uniform seemed to have paralysed her with terror. "Come, come,
madame," I exclaimed impatiently; "it is a simple question."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you frighten her," said the young lady. "It is my
aunt, the Baroness Granville."</p>

<p>"You tell me nothing of yourself," I said to her, and she looked at
me in surprise.</p>

<p>"Since you have come with an escort to this house I imagined you
must know to whom it belonged. I am Sophie de Villetaneuse."</p>

<p>"Exactly," I replied, as though I had known all along, and had
merely asked the question to see whether she would speak the truth.
"Now, mademoiselle, will you please explain to me how it is that while
your neighbours have fled you remain at your château?"</p>

<p>"It is quite simple," she answered. "My mother is bed-ridden.
She could not be moved. She could not be left alone."</p>

<p>"You will pardon me," said I, "if I test that statement."</p>

<p>The wounded officer raised himself upon his elbow as though to protest,
but Mademoiselle de Villetaneuse put out a hand and checked him.
She showed me a face flushed with anger, but she spoke quite quietly.</p>

<p>"I will myself take you to my mother's room."</p>

<p>I laughed. I said: "That is just what I expected. You will take
me to your mother's room and leave your friends here to make any little
preparations in the way of burning awkward papers which they may
think desirable. Thank you, no! I am not so easily caught."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Sophie was becoming irritated.</p>

<p>"There are no awkward papers!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That statement, too, I shall put to the
test."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I went to the door, and standing so that I could still keep an eye
upon the room, I called the corporal.</p>

<p>"You will search the house thoroughly," I said, "and quickly.
Bring me word how many people you find in it. You, mademoiselle,
will remain in the room with us."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 223px;">
<img src="images/i_116.png" width="223" height="400" alt="back of woman" />
</div>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders as I closed the door and came back into
the room.</p>

<p>"You were wounded, monsieur," I said to the Frenchman.
"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the sortie on Le Bourget."</p>

<p>"And you came here the moment you were released on your
parole?"</p>

<p>The wounded officer turned with a smile to Mademoiselle Sophie.</p>

<p>"Yes, for here live my best friends."</p>

<p>He took her hand, and with a Frenchman's grace he raised it to
his lips and kissed it. And I was suddenly made acquainted with the
relationship in which these two, youth and maid, stood to one another.
Mademoiselle Sophie had cried out on the steps against the possibility
that I might have come to claim my prisoner. But though she spoke
no word, she was still more explicit now. With the officer that
caress was plainly no more than a pretty way of saying thanks; it
had the look of a habit, it was so neatly given, and he gave it
without carelessness, it is true, but without warmth. But she
received it very differently. He did not see, because his head
was bent above her hand, but I did.</p>

<p>I saw the look of pain in her face, the slight contraction
of her shoulders and arms, as if to meet a blow. The kiss hurt
her&mdash;no, not the kiss, but the finished grace with which it was
given, the proof, in a word, that it was a way of saying "Thanks"&mdash;and
nothing more. Here was a woman who loved and a man who
did not love, and the woman knew.</p>

<p>I resumed my questions:</p>

<p>"Your doctor, monsieur, is in the house?"</p>

<p>"At this hour? No."</p>

<p>"Ah. That is a pity."</p>

<p>The young man lifted his head from his pillow and looked me over
from head to foot with a stare of disdain.</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand. You doubt my word, monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked sharply.</p>


<p>It was quite possible that the cradle, this rug across his legs, the
pillow, were all pretences. This young officer might very well have
brought in a cipher message to the Château Villetaneuse. Mademoiselle
Sophie might very well have waved her lantern at the door to summon
a fresh messenger.</p>

<p>"No; why should I not doubt your word?" I repeated.</p>

<p>He turned his face to the old lady. "It is your move, Baronne,"
he said, and she placed the piece she held upon a square of the board.
Mademoiselle Sophie took her stand by the table between the players,
and the game went on just as though there were no intruder in the
room. It was uncomfortable for me. I shifted my feet. I tried to
appear at my ease; finally I sat down in a chair. They took no notice
of me whatever. I was very glad when at last the corporal opened the
door. He had searched the house&mdash;he had found no one but Madame
de Villetaneuse and an old servant who was watching by her bed.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, and the corporal returned to the hall.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Sophie moved away from the chess-table. She came
and stood opposite to me, and though her face was still, her eyes were
hard with anger.</p>

<p>"And now perhaps you will tell me to what I owe your visit?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I returned. I fixed my eyes on her, and I said slowly,
"I have come to ask for more news of M. Bonnet's black cat."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Sophie stared as if she was not sure whether I was
mad or drunk, but was very sure I was one or the other. The young
Frenchman started upon his couch, with the veins swelling upon his
forehead and a flushed face.</p>

<p>"This is an insult," he cried savagely, and no less savagely I
answered him.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" I cried. "You forget too often that though
you are on parole you are still a prisoner."</p>

<p>He fell back upon the sofa with a groan of pain, and the girl hurried
to his side.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 171px;">
<img src="images/i_119.png" width="171" height="400" alt="Woman still with hand on a door" />
</div>

<p>Meanwhile I had been looking about the room for a box or a case
where the cipher messages might be hid. I saw nothing of the kind.
Of course they might be hidden between the pages of a book. I went
from table to table, taking them by the boards and shaking the leaves.
Not a scrap of paper tumbled out. There was another door in the room
besides that which led on to the landing.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, what room is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My bedroom," she answered simply, and with a gesture full of
dignity she threw open the door.</p>

<p>I carried the mud and snow and the grime of a camp without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
scruple of remorse into that neat and pretty chamber. Mademoiselle
Sophie followed me as I searched wardrobe and drawer and box. At
last I came to one drawer in her dressing-table which was locked. I
looked suddenly at the young lady. She was watching me out of the
corners of her eyes with a peculiar intentness.</p>

<p>"Open that drawer, mademoiselle," I said.</p>

<p>"It contains only some private things."</p>

<p>"Open that drawer or I burst it open."</p>

<p>"No," she cried, as I jerked the handle. "I will open it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/i_120.png" width="184" height="400" alt="Lady standing" />
</div>

<p>She fetched the key out of another drawer which was unlocked,
and fitted it into the lock of the dressing-table. And all the while I
saw that she was watching me. She meant to play me some trick,
I was certain. So I watched, too, and I did well to watch. She
turned the key, opened the drawer, and then snatched out something
with extraordinary rapidity and ran as hard as she could to the door&mdash;not
the door through which we had entered, but a second door which
gave on to the passage. She ran very fast and she ran very lightly,
and she did not stumble over a chair as I did in pursuit of her. But
she had to unlatch the door and pull it open. I caught her up and
closed my arms about her. It was a little carved ebony box which
she held, the very thing for which I searched.</p>

<p>"I thought so," I cried, with a laugh. "Drop the box, mademoiselle.
Drop it on the floor!"</p>

<p>The noise of our struggle had been heard in the next room.
The Baroness rushed through the doorway.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she cried. "Mon Dieu! you are
killing her!"</p>

<p>"Drop that box, mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>And as I spoke she threw it away. She threw it through the
doorway; she tried to throw it over the banisters of the stairs, but my
arms were about hers, and it fell in the passage just beyond the door.
I darted from her and picked it up. When I returned with it she was
taking a gold chain from her neck. At the end of the chain hung a
little gold key. This she held out to me.</p>

<p>"Open it here," she said in a low, eager voice.</p>

<p>The sudden change only increased my suspicions, or rather my
conviction, that I had now the proof which I needed.</p>

<p>"Why, if you are so eager to show me the contents, did you try
to throw it away?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I tried to throw it down into the hall," she answered.</p>

<p>"My corporal would have picked it up."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what would that matter?" she exclaimed impatiently.
"You would have opened it in the hall. That was what I wanted.
Open it here! At all events open it here!"</p>

<p>The very urgency of her pleading made me determined to refuse
the plea.</p>

<p>"No, you have some other ruse, mademoiselle," said I. "Perhaps
you wish to gain time for your friend in the next room. No, we will
return there and open it comfortably by the fire."</p>

<p>I kept a tight hold upon the box. I shook it. To my delight I
felt that there were papers within it. I carried it back to the fireside
and sat down on a chair. Mademoiselle Sophie followed me close, and
as I fixed the little gold key into the lock she laid her hand very gently
upon my arm.</p>

<p>"I beg you not to unlock that box," she said; "if you do you will
bring upon me a great humiliation and upon yourself much remorse.
There is nothing there which concerns you. There are just my little
secrets. A girl may have secrets, monsieur, which are sacred to her."</p>

<p>She was standing quite close to me, and her back was towards the
French officer and her aunt. They could not see her face, and they
could hardly have heard more than a word here and there of what she
said. I answered her only by turning the key in the lock. She took her
hand from my arm and laid it on the lid to hinder me from opening it.</p>

<p>"I wore the key on a chain about my neck, monsieur," she
whispered. "Does that teach you nothing? Even though you are
young, does it teach you nothing? I said that if you unlocked that
box you would cause me great humiliation, thinking that would be
enough to stop you. But I see I must tell you more. Read the
letters, monsieur, question me about them, and you will make my life
a very lonely one. I think so. I think you will destroy my chance
of happiness. You would not wish that, monsieur. It is true that we
are enemies, but some day this war will end, and you would not wish
to prolong its sufferings beyond the end. Yet you will be doing that,
monsieur, if you open that box."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i_121.png" width="360" height="400" alt="Woman next to seated soldier" />
</div>

<p>It seems now almost impossible to me that I could have doubted
her sincerity: she spoke with so much simplicity,
and so desperate an appeal looked out from her
dark eyes. Ever since that Christmas night I can
see her quite clearly at will, standing as she then
stood&mdash;all the sincerity of her which I would not
acknowledge, all the appeal which I would not
hear; and I see her many times when for my peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I would rather not. She was pleading for her pride, and to do that the
better she laid her pride aside; yet she never lost her dignity. She was
pleading for her chance of happiness, foreseeing that it was likely to be
destroyed, without any reason or any profit to a living being, by a
stranger who would the next moment pass out of her life. Yet there
was no outcry, and there were no tears. Had it been a trick&mdash;I ask
the ladies&mdash;would there not have been tears?</p>

<p>But I thought it a trick and a cheap one. She was trying to make
me believe that there were love-letters in the box&mdash;compromising love-letters.
Now, I <i>knew</i> that there were no love-letters in the box. I
had seen the Frenchman's pretty way of saying thanks. I had
noticed how the caress hurt her just through what it lacked. He was
the friend, you see, and nothing more; she was the lover and the only
lover of the pair.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 223px;">
<img src="images/i_122.png" width="223" height="400" alt="woman" />
</div>

<p>I opened the box accordingly. Mademoiselle Sophie turned away
abruptly, and sitting down in a chair shaded her eyes with her hand.
I emptied the letters out on to a table, turning the box upside down,
and thus the first which I took up and read was the one which lay at
the very bottom. As I read it it seemed that every suspicion I had
formed was established. She had hinted at love-letters, she had
spoken of secrets sacred to a girl; and the letter was not even
addressed to her. It was addressed to Madame de Villetaneuse;
it was a letter which, if it meant no more than what was implied
upon the surface, would have long since found destruction in the
waste-paper basket. For it purported to be merely the acceptance
of an invitation to dinner at the town house of Madame de
Villetaneuse in the Faubourg St. Germain. It was signed only
by a Christian name, "Armand," and the few sentences which
composed the letter explained that M. Armand was a distant
kinsman of Madame de Villetaneuse who had just come to Paris
to pursue his studies, and who, up till now, had no acquaintance
with the family.</p>

<p>I looked at Mademoiselle Sophie sternly. "So all this
pother was about a mere invitation to dinner! Once let it be
known that M. Armand will dine with Madame de Villetaneuse
in the Faubourg St. Germain, and you are humiliated, you lose
your chance of happiness, and I, too, shall find myself in good
time suffering the pangs of remorse," and I read the letter
slowly aloud to her, word by word.</p>

<p>She returned no answer. She sat with her hand shading her face,
and she rocked her head backwards and forwards continually and rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
quickly, like a child with a racking headache. Of course, to my mind
all that was part of the game. The letter was dated two years back, but
the month was December, and, of course, to antedate would be the
first precaution.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/i_123.png" width="316" height="400" alt="crying about news" />
</div>

<p>"Come, mademoiselle," I said, changing my tone, "I invite you
very seriously to make a clean breast of it. I wish to take no harsh
measures with you if I can avoid them. Tell me frankly what news
this letter, plainly translated, gives to General Trochu in Paris."</p>

<p>"None," she answered.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, and I took up the next letter. Ah, M. Armand
writes again a week later. It was evidently a good dinner, and M.
Armand is properly grateful.</p>

<p>The gratitude, indeed, was rather excessive, rather provincial. It
was just the effusion which a young man who had not yet learned self-possession
might have written on his first introduction to the highest
social life of Paris. Certainly the correspondence was very artfully
designed. But what did it hide? I puzzled over the question; I
took the words and the dates, and it seemed to me that I began to
see light. So much stress was laid upon the dinner, that the word
must signify some event of importance. The first letter spoke of a
dinner in the future. I imagined that it had not been possible
to pass this warning into Paris. The second letter mentioned
with gratitude that the dinner had been successful. Well, suppose
"dinner" stood for "engagement"! The letter would refer to the
sortie from Paris which pushed back our lines and captured Ville
Evrart and Maison Blanche. That seemed likely. Madame de Villetaneuse
gave the dinner; General Trochu made the sortie. Then
"Madame de Villetaneuse" stood for "General Trochu." Who would
be Armand? Why, the French people outside Paris&mdash;the provincials!
I had the explanation of that provincial expression of gratitude. Ah,
no doubt it all seems far-fetched now that we sit quietly about this
table. But put yourself in the thick of the war and
take twenty years off your lives! Suppose yourselves
young and green, eager for advancement, and just
off your balance from want of sleep, want of food,
want of rest, want of everything. There are very
few things which would seem far-fetched. It seemed
to me that I was deciphering these letters with
absolute accuracy. I saw myself promoted to captain,
seconded to the staff.</p>

<p>I went on with the letters, hoping to find an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
explanation there. The third letter was addressed to Mademoiselle de
Villetaneuse, who had evidently written to M. Armand on behalf of
her mother, inviting him to her box at the opera. M. Armand regretted
that he had not been fortunate enough to call at a time when
mademoiselle was at home, and would look forward to the pleasure of
seeing her at the Opera.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I cried, "what does the Opera stand for?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Sophie laughed disdainfully.</p>

<p>"For music, monsieur, for art, for refinement, for many things you
do not understand."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/i_124.png" width="382" height="400" alt="invalid soldier leaning on chairs" />
</div>

<p>I sprang up in excitement. What did it matter what she said?
M. Armand stood for the Army of the Loire. It was that army which
had been expected at Ville Evrart. Here was a pledge that it would
come to the help of Paris at the next sortie. That was valuable news&mdash;it
could not but bring recognition to the man who brought evidence of
it into the Prussian lines. I hurriedly read through the other letters,
quoting a passage here and there, trying to startle Mademoiselle de
Villetaneuse into a confession. But she never changed her attitude,
she did not answer a word.</p>

<p>Her conduct was the more aggravating, for I began to get lost
among these letters. They were all in the same handwriting; they
were all signed "Armand," and they seemed to give a picture of the
life of a young man in Paris during the two years which preceded the
war. They recorded dinner-parties, visits to the theatres, examinations
passed, prizes won and lost, receptions, rides in the Bois, and Sunday
excursions into the country. All these phrases, these appointments,
these meetings, might have particular meanings. But if so, how
stupendous a cipher! Besides, how was it that none of these messages
had been passed into Paris? Very reluctantly I began to doubt my
own conjecture. I read some more letters, and then I suddenly turned
back to the earlier ones. I compared them with the later notes. I
began to be afraid the correspondence, after all, was genuine, for the
tone of the letters changed and changed so gradually,
and yet so clearly, that the greatest literary
art could hardly have deliberately composed
them. I seemed to witness the actual progress
of M. Armand, a hobbledehoy from the provinces,
losing his awkwardness, acquiring ease and
polish in his contact with the refinement
of Paris. The last letters had the postmark
of Paris, the first that of Auvergne.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>They were genuine, then. And they were not love-letters. I
looked at Mademoiselle Sophie with an increased perplexity. Why did
she now sit rocking her head like a child in pain? Why had she so
struggled to hinder me from opening them? They recorded a beginning
of acquaintanceship and the growth of that into friendship between a
young man and a young girl&mdash;nothing more. The friendship might
eventually end in marriage, no doubt, if left to itself, but there was not
a word of that in the letters. I was still wondering, when the French
officer raised himself from his sofa and dragged himself across the room
to Mademoiselle Sophie's chair. His left trouser leg had been slit down
the side from the knee to the foot and laced lightly so as to make room
for a bandage. He supported himself from chair to chair with evident
pain, and I could not doubt that his wound was as genuine as
the letters.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">
<img src="images/i_125.png" width="226" height="400" alt="woman standing" />
</div>

<p>He bent down and gently took her hand away from her face.</p>

<p>"Sophie," he said, "I did not dare to think that you kept this
place for me in your thoughts. A little more courage and I should
long since have said to you what I say now. I beg your permission to
ask Madame de Villetaneuse to-morrow for your hand in marriage."</p>

<p>My house of cards tumbled down in a second. The French officer
was M. Armand. With the habit women have of treasuring tokens of
the things which have happened, Mademoiselle Sophie had kept all these
trifling notes and messages, and had even gathered to them the letters
written to her mother, so that the story might be complete. But
without M. Armand's knowledge; he was not to know; her pride must
guard her secret from him. For she was the lover and he only the
friend, and she knew it. Even in the little speech which he had just
made, there was just too much formality, just too little sincerity of
voice. I understood why she had tried to throw the ebony box down
into the hall so that I might open it there&mdash;I understood that I had
caused her great humiliation. But that was not all there was for me
to understand.</p>

<p>In answer to Armand she raised her eyes quietly, and shook
her head.</p>

<p>"You wish to spare me shame," she said, "and I thank you very
much. But it is because of these letters that you spoke. I must think
that. I must always think it."</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But yes," she replied firmly. "If monsieur had not unlocked that
box&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but some day perhaps&mdash;oh, not yet, no, not yet&mdash;but
some day perhaps you might have come of your own accord and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
said what you have just said. And I should have been very happy.
But now you never must. For you see I shall always think that the
letters are prompting you."</p>

<p>And M. Armand bowed.</p>

<p>I had taken from her her chance of happiness. The friendship
between them might have ended in marriage if left to itself. But I had
not left it to itself.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I said, "I am very sorry."</p>

<p>She turned her dark eyes on me.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I warned you. It is too late to be sorry." And as I
stood shuffling awkwardly from one foot to the other, in great remorse
as she had foretold, she added, gently, "Will you not go, monsieur?"</p>

<p>I went out of the room, called together my escort, mounted and
rode off. It was past midnight now, and the night was clear. But I
thought neither of the little beds under the slope of the roof nor of any
danger on the road. There might have been a <i>franc-tireur</i> behind
every tree. I would never have noticed it until one of them had
brought me down. Remorse was heavy upon me. I had behaved
without consideration, without chivalry, without any manners at all.
I had not been able to distinguish truth when it stared me in the face,
or to recognise honesty when it looked out from a young girl's dark
eyes. I had behaved, in a word, like the brute six months of war had
made of me. I wondered with a vague hope whether after all time might
not set matters right between M. Armand and Mademoiselle Sophie.
And I wonder now whether it has. But even if I knew that it had, I
should always remember that Christmas night of 1870 with acute regret.
The only incident, indeed, which I can mention with the slightest
satisfaction is this: On the way back to Noisy-le-Grand I came to a
point where the road from Chelles crossed the road from Montfermeil.
I halted at a little cabin which stood upon a grass-plot within the angle
of the roads, and tying up all the money I had on me in a pocket-handkerchief
I dropped the handkerchief through a broken window-pane.</p>

<p>The Colonel let the end of his cigar fall upon his plate, and pushed
back his chair from the table. "But I see we shall be late for the
opera," he said, as he glanced at the clock.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> were such a happy family before this terrible revolution broke
out: we lived rather simply but very comfortably in our dear old home
just on the borders of the forest of Compiègne. Jean and André were
the twins; just fifteen years old they were when King Louis was
deposed from the throne of France, which God had given him, and
sent to prison like a common criminal, with our beautiful Queen Marie
Antoinette and the Royal children and Madame Elizabeth, who was
so beloved by the poor!</div>

<p>Ah! that seems very, very long ago now. No doubt you know
better than I do all that happened in our beautiful land of France and
in lovely Paris about that time: goods and property confiscated,
innocent men, women, and children condemned to death for acts of
treason which they had never committed.</p>

<p>It was in August last year that they came to "Mon Repos" and
arrested papa, maman, and us four young ones and dragged us to
Paris, where we were imprisoned in a narrow and horrible, dank vault
in the Abbaye, where all day and night through the humid stone walls
we heard cries and sobs and moans from poor people who no doubt
were suffering the same sorrows and the same indignities as we were.</p>

<p>I had just passed my nineteenth birthday and Marguerite was
only thirteen. Maman was a perfect angel during that terrible time:
she kept up our courage and our faith in God in a way that no one
else could have done. Every night and morning we knelt round her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
knee, and papa sat close beside her, and we prayed to God for
deliverance from our own afflictions, and for the poor people who
were crying and moaning all the day.</p>

<p>But of what went on outside our prison walls we had not an idea,
though sometimes poor papa would brave the warder's brutalities and
ask him questions of what was happening in Paris every day.</p>

<p>"They are hanging all the aristos to the street-lamps of the city,"
the man would reply, with a cruel laugh, "and it will be your turn
next."</p>

<p>We had been in prison for about a fortnight, then one day&mdash;oh!
shall I ever forget it?&mdash;we heard in the distance a noise like the rumbling
of thunder; nearer and nearer it came, and soon the sound became less
confused. Cries and shrieks could be heard above that rumbling din,
but so weird and menacing did those cries seem, that instinctively&mdash;though
none of us knew what they meant&mdash;we all felt a nameless terror
grip our hearts.</p>

<p>Oh! I am not going to attempt the awful task of describing to you
all the horrors of that never-to-be-forgotten day. People who to-day
cannot speak without a shudder of the September massacres have not
the remotest conception of what really happened on that truly awful
second day of that month.</p>

<p>We are all at peace and happy now, but whenever my thoughts
fly back to that morning, whenever the ears of memory recall those
hideous yells of fury and of hate, coupled with the equally horrible
cries for pity which pierced through the walls behind which the six
of us were crouching, trembling, and praying, whenever I think of it
all my heart still beats violently with that same nameless dread which
held it in its deathly grip then.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/i_132.png" width="228" height="400" alt="man with head in hands" />
</div>
<p>Hundreds of men, women, and children were
massacred in the prisons of Paris on that day&mdash;it was
a St. Bartholomew even more hideous than the last.</p>

<p>Maman was trying in vain to keep our thoughts
fixed upon God&mdash;papa sat on the stone bench, his
elbows resting on his knees, his head buried in his
hands, but maman was kneeling on the floor with her
dear arms encircling us all, and her trembling lips
moving in continuous prayer.</p>



<p>We felt that we were facing death&mdash;and what a
death!&mdash;O, my God!</p>

<p>Suddenly the small grated window&mdash;high up in
the dank wall&mdash;became obscured. I was the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
look up, but the cry of terror which rose from
my heart was choked ere it reached my throat.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/i_133.png" width="291" height="400" alt="man looking through window" />
</div>
<p>Jean and André looked up too, and they
shrieked, and so did Marguerite, and papa jumped
up and ran to us and stood suddenly between
us and the window like a tiger defending its
young.</p>



<p>But we were all of us quite silent now. The
children did not even cry, they stared wide-eyed&mdash;paralysed
with fear.</p>

<p>Only maman continued to pray, and we could
hear papa's rapid and stertorous breathing as he
watched what was going on in that window above.</p>

<p>Heavy blows were falling against the masonry
round the grating, and we could hear the nerve-racking
sound of a file working on the iron bars,
and farther away below the window those awful
yells of human beings transformed by hate and
fury into savage beasts.</p>

<p>How long this horrible suspense lasted I
cannot now tell you: the next thing I remember clearly is a number of
men in horrible ragged clothing pouring into our vault-like prison from
the window above; the next moment they rushed at us simultaneously&mdash;or
so it seemed to me, for I was just then recommending my soul to
God, so certain was I that in that same second I would cease to live.</p>

<p>It was all like a dream, for instead of the horrible shriek of satisfied
hate which we were all expecting to hear, a whispering voice, commanding
and low, struck our ear and dragged us, as it were, from out the
abyss of despair into the sudden light of hope.</p>

<p>"If you will trust us," the voice whispered, "and not be afraid, you
will be safely out of Paris within an hour."</p>

<p>Papa was the first to realise what was happening: he had never lost
his presence of mind, even during the darkest moment of this terrible
time, and he said quite calmly and steadily now:</p>

<p>"What must we do?"</p>

<p>"Persuade the little ones not to be afraid, not to cry, to be as still
and silent as may be," continued the voice, which I felt must be that of
one of God's own angels, so exquisitely kind did it sound to my ear.</p>

<p>"They will be quiet and still without persuasion," said papa; "eh,
children?"</p>

<p>And Jean, André, and Marguerite murmured: "Yes!" whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
maman and I drew them closer to us and said everything
we could think of to make them still more brave.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 243px;">
<img src="images/i_134.png" width="243" height="400" alt="man being helped" />
</div>

<p>And the whispering, commanding voice went on
after awhile:</p>

<p>"Now, will you allow yourselves to be muffled
and bound? and after that will you swear that whatever
happens, whatever you may see or hear, you will
neither move nor speak. Not only your own lives, but
those of many brave men will depend upon your fulfilment
of this oath."</p>

<p>Papa made no reply, save to raise his hand and
eyes up to where God surely was watching over us all.
Maman said in her gentle, even voice:</p>

<p>"For myself and my children, I swear to do all
that you tell us."</p>


<p>A great feeling of confidence had entered into her
heart, just as it had done into mine. We looked at
one another and knew that we were both thinking
of the same thing: we were thinking of the brave
Englishman and his gallant little band of heroes about whom we had
heard many wonderful tales of how they had rescued a number of
innocent people who were unjustly threatened with the guillotine; and
we all knew that the tall figure disguised in horrible rags, who spoke to
us with such a gentle yet commanding voice, was the man whom
rumour credited with supernatural powers, and who was known by the
mysterious name of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Hardly had we sworn to do his bidding than his friends most
unceremoniously threw great pieces of sacking over our heads and then
proceeded to tie ropes round our bodies. At least I know that that is
what one of them was doing to me, and from one or two whispered
words of command which reached my ear I concluded that papa and
maman and the children were being dealt with in the same summary way.</p>

<p>I felt hot and stifled under that rough bit of sacking, but I would
not have moved or even sighed for worlds. Strangely enough, as soon as
my eyes and ears were shut off from the sounds and sights immediately
round me, I once more became conscious of the horrible and awful din
which was going on not only on the other side of our prison walls, but
inside the whole of the Abbaye building and in the street beyond.</p>

<p>Once more I heard those terrible howls of rage and of satisfied
hatred uttered by the assassins who were being paid by the Government
of our beautiful country to butcher helpless prisoners in their hundreds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/i_135.png" width="363" height="600" alt="The Scarlet Pimpernel to the Rescue painting" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly I felt myself hoisted up off my feet and slung up on to a
pair of shoulders that must have been very powerful indeed, for I am
no light weight, and once more I heard the voice, the very sound of
which was delight, quite close to my ear this time, giving a brief and
comprehensive command:</p>

<p>"All ready&mdash;remember your part&mdash;en avant!"</p>

<p>Then it added in English; "Here, Tony, you start kicking against
the door whilst we begin to shout!"</p>

<p>I loved those few words of English, and hoped that maman had
heard them too, for it would confirm her&mdash;as it did me&mdash;in the happy
knowledge that God and a brave man had taken our rescue in hand.</p>

<p>But from that moment we might all have been in the very antechamber
of hell. I could hear the violent kicks against the heavy door
of our prison, and our brave rescuers seemed suddenly to be transformed
into a cageful of wild beasts. Their shouts and yells were as horrible as
any that came to us from the outside, and I must say that the gentle, firm
voice which I had learnt to love was as execrable as any I could hear.</p>

<p>Apparently the door would not yield, as the blows against it
became more and more violent, and presently, from somewhere above
my head&mdash;the window presumably&mdash;there came a rough call and a
raucous laugh:</p>

<p>"Why! what in the name of &mdash;&mdash; is happening here?"</p>

<p>And the voice near me answered back equally roughly:</p>

<p>"A quarry of six&mdash;but we are caught in this trap&mdash;get the door
open for us, citizen&mdash;we want to be rid of this booty and go in search
for more."</p>

<p>A horrible laugh was the reply from above, and the next instant
I heard a terrific crash; the door had at last been burst open either
from within or without, I could not tell which, and suddenly all the din,
the cries, the groans, the hideous laughter and bibulous songs which
had sounded muffled up to now burst upon us with all their hideousness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px;">
<img src="images/i_137.png" width="578" height="400" alt="A motley crew" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>That was, I think, the most awful moment of that truly fearful
hour. I could not have moved then, even had I wished or been able
to do so, but I knew that between us all and a horrible, yelling,
murdering mob there was now nothing&mdash;except the hand of God and
the heroism of a band of English gentlemen.</p>

<p>Together they gave a cry&mdash;as loud, as terrifying as any that were
uttered by the butchering crowd in the building, and with a wild rush
they seemed to plunge with us right into the thick of the awful mêlée.</p>

<p>At least that is what it all felt like to me, and afterwards I heard
from our gallant rescuer himself that that is exactly what he and his
friends did. There were eight of them altogether, and we four young
ones had each been hoisted on a pair of devoted shoulders, whilst
maman and papa were each carried by two men.</p>

<p>I was lying across the finest pair of shoulders in the world, and
close to me was beating the bravest heart on God's earth.</p>

<p>Thus burdened, these eight noble English gentlemen charged right
through an army of butchering, howling brutes, they themselves howling
with the fiercest of them.</p>

<p>All around me I heard weird and terrifying cries:</p>

<p>"What ho, citizens! what have you there?"</p>

<p>"Six aristos!" shouted my hero boldly as he rushed on, forcing his
way through the crowd.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with them?" yelled a raucous voice.</p>

<p>"Food for the starving fish in the river," was the ready response.
"Stand aside, citizen," he added, with a round curse. "I have my orders
from citizen Danton himself about these six aristos. You hinder me at
your peril."</p>

<p>He was challenged over and over again in the same way, and so
were his friends who were carrying papa and maman and the children,
but they were always ready for a reply. With eyes that could not
see one could imagine them as hideous, as vengeful, as cruel as the rest
of the crowd.</p>

<p>I think that soon I must have fainted from sheer excitement and
terror, for I remember nothing more till I felt myself deposited on a
hard floor, propped against the wall, and the stifling piece of sacking
taken off my head and face.</p>

<p>I looked around me dazed and bewildered; gradually the horrors
of the past hour came back to me, and I had to close my eyes again, for
I felt sick and giddy with the sheer memory of it all.</p>

<p>But presently I felt stronger and looked around me again. Jean
and André were squatting in a corner close by, gazing wide-eyed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
group of men in filthy, ragged clothing who sat round a deal table in
the centre of a small, ill-furnished room.</p>

<p>Maman was lying on a horse-hair sofa at the other end of the room,
with Marguerite beside her, and papa sat in a low chair by her side
holding her hand.</p>

<p>The voice I loved was speaking in its quaint, somewhat drawly
cadence:</p>

<p>"You are quite safe now, my dear Monsieur Lemercier," it said.
"After Madame and the young people have had a rest some of my friends
will find you suitable disguises, and they will escort you out of Paris, as
they have some really genuine passports in their possession, which we
obtain from time to time through the agency of a personage highly placed
in this murdering Government, and with the help of English banknotes.
Those passports are not always unchallenged, I must confess," added my
hero, with a quaint laugh, "but to-night every one is busy murdering in
one part of Paris, so the other parts are comparatively safe."</p>

<p>Then he turned to one of his friends and spoke to him in English:</p>

<p>"You had better see this through, Tony," he said, "with Hastings
and Mackenzie. Three of you will be enough: I shall have need of the
others."</p>

<p>No one seemed to question his orders. He had spoken and the
others made ready to obey. Just then papa spoke up:</p>

<p>"How are we going to thank you, sir?" he asked, speaking broken
English, but with his habitual dignity of manner.</p>

<p>"By leaving your welfare in our hands, Monsieur," replied our gallant
rescuer quietly.</p>

<p>Papa tried to speak again, but the Englishman put up his hand to
stop any further talk.</p>

<p>"There is no time now, Monsieur," he said, with gentle courtesy.
"I must leave you, as I have much work yet to do."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Blakeney?" asked one of the others.</p>

<p>"Back to the Abbaye prison," he said; "there are other women and
children to be rescued there!"</p>

<h2>ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT</h2>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">I knew</span> a child who&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<p>Some friends of mine have a daughter, and she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Not very many years ago, I remember hearing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Once upon a time&mdash;that is the proper way to begin this story&mdash;once
upon a time there was a little girl, of about the usual age, who
lived near to St. John's Wood Road Station, handy to Lord's cricket
ground, and not far from the Zoological Gardens. You would think
that any one who, in the summer, could look out of her window and see
Mr. P. F. Warner batting, and in the winter was able to go any afternoon
she liked, to watch the lions and tigers take high tea at four, ought
to have been as happy as the days were long; cheerful even when the
days were short. Yet she was not entirely satisfied; it may be said that
her one failing was a spirit of discontent. When grown-ups are discontented,
it is called ambition; but that is another matter.</p>

<p>On a certain Tuesday evening in November it happened that she
felt quite pleased with the world until about seven o'clock. Seven
in the evening was the hour that frequently made her peevish.</p>

<p>Nurse left her alone for a minute to see if everything was ready
upstairs, and in that minute the little girl jumped on a chair and moved
back the long hand. She was reading her picture-book with great
interest when nurse returned.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/i_146.png" width="270" height="400" alt="Girl adjusting clock" />
</div>

<p>"Bless my soul!" cried nurse. "Quite thought
it wanted ten to seven, and here it is only ten past
six. I shall find myself in Colney Hatch before I'm
much older."</p>

<p>The little girl wanted to assure Nanna there was
no good reason to assume that mental decay had set
in, but she did not do this at once, and afterwards it seemed
too late. So nurse was allowed to chat on, and tell her very
best story about the time when she was a child, and a good one
at that, and when the clock, having been compelled to go over
the ground twice, again gave the time as ten to seven, nurse said,</p>

<p>"Now my dearie!"</p>

<p>Upstairs, the little girl devoted a few minutes to instructing
her dolly in the art of going off nicely to bye-byes.</p>

<p>She was left alone, with just a mere star of gas-light
for company shining above the dressing-table, and at the
moment when she was about to go to sleep conscience woke
up. Conscience became wide-awake. Conscience insisted upon
talking, and the little girl had to listen. She was aware it is
useless to cry when one is by oneself with nobody looking on; not
only useless but wasteful, because you may want those tears on more
important and more public occasions. So the little girl did not weep,
but, oh! she felt troubled. She did feel troubled.</p>

<p>"A silly, stupid world!" she cried aloud. "It ought&mdash;it
ought to be changed. I'd very much love it to be altogether
different."</p>

<p>A knock at her door, and she answered, "Please come in, Nanna!"
Not nurse. Certainly the tall lady with diamonds sparkling in her
hair, and a white chiffon kind of costume, and a long silver stick in the
right hand, was as unlike nurse as any one could be. The little girl
said, "Oh, I beg pardon!" in her politest manner.</p>

<p>"It is for me to beg yours," answered the tall lady with severity.
"I am exceedingly sorry to disturb you."</p>

<p>"Pray don't mention it."</p>

<p>"I wish to mention it," insisted the lady. "I claim the right to
mention it. I decline to allow any one to dictate to me what I shall or
what I shall not mention. I am a good fairy."</p>

<p>The little girl opened her mouth with surprise.</p>

<p>"A good fairy, and I am here to do you a favour. When a good
fairy wishes to do a favour, it is only necessary for a wish to be expressed,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/i_147.png" width="439" height="550" alt="surprised at the time" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Bless my soul!&quot; cried nurse</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said the child nervously, "but really I would so
much rather you did not take the trouble."</p>

<p>"The trouble," replied the good fairy, striking the floor with her
silver stick in an impatient way, "is no concern of yours. You mustn't
haggle."</p>

<p>"I don't know what that means," declared the other earnestly,
"and if I did, I wouldn't do it, ma'am, I wouldn't really. Good
evening, and, of course, thank you ever so much for calling."</p>

<p>"Dress!" ordered the good fairy.</p>

<p>On the instant something happened which the little girl had often
thought about; more than once she had talked it over with nurse.
She found herself, in the space of less time than it takes to click your
finger and thumb, fully and completely costumed, boots laced up, hair
taken out of curlers and properly brushed, hat set at the correct angle,
parasol in hand, gloves buttoned, and everything ready for a walk out
of doors. She gave a cry of delight and astonishment.</p>

<p>"I am about to give you the great treat of your life," said the
fairy, "something that no one has ever yet experienced, something that
will give you a subject to talk about for the rest of your days. Nobody
will believe you, but that must be endured. You are about to see the
world as nobody else has seen it. And if you ask me why you have
been selected for this high and special honour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, I don't!"</p>

<p>"My answer is," taking no notice of the interruption, "that you
are receiving the award for your wonderful discovery."</p>

<p>"But I have discovered nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing!" echoed the lady, with amazement. "You call it
nothing to have found out the secret that has puzzled clever people
for thousands and thousands of years? How often folk have said, 'If
only I could live some part of my life over again!' and they never have
been able to do it. You, child, were the first."</p>

<p>The staircase had always gone straight down until it neared the
next landing, where it took a slight curve; now it was all curves and
had nothing about it that could be called straight. It went up, it went
down, it went to the left, it went to the right, so that wherever you put
your foot expecting to find a step, you did not find it, and wherever you
put your foot expecting to find nothing, you hurt your toes.</p>

<p>"This is very strange, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"That," replied the other, "should be its great attraction. Don't
lag. We shall get to the end of the staircase in less than ten minutes."</p>

<p>Going out of the street doorway proved one of the most difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tasks. The fairy did not seem to mind, but the child found it extremely
odd that when you pulled at the door it opened outwards, and that
when you pushed at it it came in. The iron gate which led to the
pavement had another form of behaviour. Determined not to be
bothered here, she gave a touch with her boot, and instantly the iron
gate offered her boot a pinch; she placed her hand upon it and the gate
gripped it, much in the way that Uncle Henry did when he said "How
do you do?" She put her back against it, and the iron gate gave her
a clutch around the waist, and said, in rasping tones, as it waltzed to
the pavement,</p>

<p>"Do you reverse?"</p>

<p>It was then that she perceived the fairy had left her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_149.png" width="500" height="395" alt="Visited by a fairy" />
</div>

<p>A pavement is expected to behave in a calm and demure manner;
even when it takes you up-hill it does this in the gentlest way. But
this pavement, so soon as the little girl set foot upon it, at once changed
to something like a switchback, and a switchback, mark you, she enjoyed
when seated on a trolley at Shepherd's Bush Exhibitions; it was less
agreeable to try to walk up and down
the uneven parts here. Other people
did not seem to experience her difficulties,
and this she failed to understand
until she observed that they
went along on their hands and toes,
pretending to have four legs; she
tried the same method and found it
made her back ache; discovered, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that she could not see so much as
when walking in the old way.
Thus it was that she had reached
the end of the road, where a steep
ascent occurred that was like the
side of a mountain, ere she noticed
something strange and peculiar
about the houses.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/i_150.png" width="334" height="400" alt="pavement not behaving" />
</div>

<p>"How very foolish of them
to build in that way!" she cried.
"They must be out of their senses."</p>



<p>It was the more eccentric in
that her own house so far as she
had observed had not changed;
thinking it over, though, she could
not be quite sure. Here at any
rate was every house upside down
with the front door right away at
the top, Virginia creepers growing
downwards; at one house the
painters were seeing to the front and their ladders came from the roof
(which was the basement) nearly to the basement (which was the roof).
A neat lawn hung out over the top of each house; it made her feel
giddy to think of the risks of playing croquet there; she could not see
how one would be able to make even the first hoop.</p>

<p>Other things claimed her attention.</p>

<p>There were carts with horses pushing them&mdash;she had often heard
her father reprove her eldest brother for doing this in argument&mdash;the
horses stood upright and wore silk hats in a rakish sort of way, sometimes
lifting these on meeting another horse and taking cigars out of
mouths. She spoke to a constable, who wore a helmet on each hand,
and put an urgent inquiry.</p>

<p>"Miaow!" said the policeman.</p>

<p>"You didn't quite understand," remarked the little girl patiently.
"I asked you if you would kindly tell me the way to get home to
Wellington Road."</p>

<p>"Ba, ba!"</p>

<p>"Do please listen to me," she begged, "and tell me what I want
to know. I think I've lost my way, and I'm so afraid that I'm going
to cry."</p>

<p>"Moo&mdash;oo!" said the constable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="Instructing Dolly painting" />
</div>

<p>"Please, please," she cried, "please don't be silly. Why do you
keep making noises like that instead of giving me a proper answer?"</p>

<p>"Missy," he explained, "I'm a comic policeman. I'm not here to
tell folk the way or to lock them up, or anything of that kind; I'm here
to make people laugh."</p>

<p>"You are not amusing me!"</p>

<p>"Not when I make a noise like a dog?" he asked, with surprise.
"Why, that nearly always sends people into a good temper. You wait
till I give you my imitation of a railway engine. Hark!"</p>

<p>He set his teeth together and began to say "Isha&mdash;isha&mdash;isha,"
but the little girl turned away. She felt so indignant that she
determined to tell her father about it at the very first opportunity, and
see whether something could not be done. More than once her father
had helped to straighten out tangled matters by simply writing a letter
to the newspapers, and signing himself "An Indignant Ratepayer."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/i_153.png" width="240" height="400" alt="policeman" />
</div>

<p>And at the very moment along came her father. He, too, walked
on all fours as other people did, and the little girl thought it caused
him to look particularly undignified, but she did not trouble about this,
for, stout as he was, she was really glad to see him.</p>

<p>"How do you do," he said respectfully. "Can you give me a
penny to buy some sweeties?"</p>

<p>"Daddie, dear!" she cried with distress. "Don't you begin to be
funny, please."</p>

<p>"I'm not," he said.</p>

<p>"But you are my parent, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," he sighed, "I'm aware of that. But under the new rules&mdash;you
must have heard all about them&mdash;under the new rules parents have
to be obedient to their children, and do everything their children tell
them to do."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea," decided the little girl, after giving it consideration.
"I think if you don't mind I will get you to come along
now to Finchley Road and buy for me the mechanical
rocking-horse that has been talked about for some time."</p>

<p>"Under the old arrangement," he replied readily,
"I should have been only too pleased, but the new
rules say that children must buy presents for their
father and mother."</p>

<p>"How can we," getting rather cross, "how in the
world can we when we have no money?"</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "that it is expected you should
go to work and earn some."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never heard such nonsense in the whole course of my life," she
declared, using a grown-up remark. "It's perfect rubbish. Do you
mean to say that I shall have to go to concerts and sing as mamma
does?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea, I believe."</p>

<p>"But I can't sing. I can't sing nearly well enough to earn
money."</p>

<p>"Well," said her father, after considering the matter, "what about
going out as charwoman? You'd get two shillings a day and
your lunch."</p>

<p>She stood there for a few minutes, not daring to speak, and overcome
with cares and responsibilities. Some one touched her on the
shoulder, and she looked up.</p>

<p>"Good fairy!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Do you like the altogether different you asked for?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "I don't like it at all. I wish now I hadn't
put back the hands of the clock."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that that was how you did it? You dare to
tell me it was nothing cleverer than that? Now, just to punish you,"
said the fairy, speaking with stern decision, "I shall send you away to
the old sort of world, and you'll simply have to make the best of it."</p>

<p>The bedroom door opened, and nurse came in. The little girl,
snuggling down into her warm, comfortable bed, kept her eyes shut.</p>

<p>"Bless her!" said nurse to herself. "Sleeping as sound as a top.
That's what comes of having nothing on your mind to worry you!"</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Not</span> a sound broke the exquisite hush of the
early morning.</div>



<p>The old courtyard, with its tiled pavement,
its cool fountain, and its cooing doves, the dog
asleep in the sunshine, made a picture of perfect peace.</p>

<p>The house, once the Château of a great family that had fallen on
evil days, was grey and old, and beautiful still, though now merely
<i>une pension de demoiselles</i>.</p>

<p>It was August, when, as a rule, all the merry throng had
scattered from the Château to their respective homes, leaving it to its
former dignity and quiet. Mademoiselle usually went to England,
perhaps seeking fresh pupils, or to enjoy the sea breezes on the
Normandy coast.</p>

<p>La Royat, in the village of Coutane, was inland from the sea, about
fifteen miles from Brussels. It was a sweet spot, beloved of the understanding
traveller, and many came to look at the fine old church,
whose spire and windows were among the treasures known to lovers of
the beautiful all over the world. Mademoiselle Ledru had nothing to
complain of in her lot, with which she had been hitherto content. Success
had flowed in upon her earnest efforts, though looking at her anxious
face that summer morning one would have thought her oppressed by
care. She was an elderly woman now, with the remains of beauty still
on her face. The place where she stood that morning, before her household
was astir, was certainly unusual, being the square tower of the
Château, from whose low ramparts she was sweeping the horizon with a
powerful glass. It was all very peaceful and beautiful, a wide rolling
plateau, with fields white to harvest, not a hint of approaching desolation
on its smiling face.</p>

<p>It was very early, hardly an hour past daybreak, but already some
of the thrifty peasants were busy in the fields. Far away on the red
horizon there was a slight haze, regarding which Mademoiselle seemed
more than a little curious. Again and again she focused her glass, until
confident that the haze was not altogether stationary, but moved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
broke and thickened again. Then with a sickening apprehension
at her heart, she turned and fled down the stairs and went to open
the big door of the Château. Jules, the fat and sleepy porter, was
undoing the bolts as she got down.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_156.png" width="200" height="150" alt="two girls" />
</div>

<p>"Bonjour, Mademoiselle. Some one is at the gate, an early
visitor." He chuckled as he undid the last bolt, and threw wide
the door. When he would have hobbled across the courtyard to
open the gate his mistress was before him. When she undid the bolts
the Curé, bareheaded, stood before her.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle, it is bad news," he said in a firm voice,
though his face was tense with apprehension. "They come, the
barbarians. I have information, now it behoves us to consult what
we will do."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle whitened to the lips, and drew him in and shut the
door. She signed to Jules to depart, but the Curé intervened.</p>

<p>"Let him stay. It will save a twice-told tale. I have certain
news that they are not more than a couple of hours' march away, and for
sure they will come this way to Brussels. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"I will remain at my post," answered Julie Ledru firmly. "I have
no fear for myself, but my charges, Father&mdash;Rosalie and Biddy, with
whom their English parents have trusted me. My spirit fails! What
must we do with them?"</p>

<p>"It will not be safe to leave them here, Mademoiselle, nor even for
you to stay. We will take you to the crypt of the church, where, with
a little food and drink, you will be safe until they have passed through.
We have no treasure here in Coutane, and are simple folk. Perhaps
we shall be beneath their notice."</p>

<p>Julie Ledru clasped her hands in an ecstasy of apprehension. They
had been without newspapers for four days, but chance travellers
from the East had brought strange and appalling tales of the invaders'
desolating march. They told of ruined villages and burning homes,
and helpless people mercilessly shot down in places as simple and as
unimportant as Coutane. Julie Ledru looked round her little domain
with a kind of sad pride. It did not contain many treasures, it is true,
but it was her home, enshrined by many sweet memories. It contained
her all.</p>

<p>"Now, Father?" she asked feverishly. "Do you think we should
come now?"</p>

<p>"Without a moment's delay," he answered. "Go and get your
charges roused and bring all with you; a little food also in a basket, lest
you have to stop there several days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will be with us, Father?" said Julie anxiously.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"My place is in the open street with such of my people as feel
strong and brave in their innocence and faith. But you have English
charges. If it was known, Mademoiselle, believe me, nothing would
save them or you. Their fury against the English is so great."</p>

<p>"Shall we take Jules? Besides him, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'their'">there</ins> is only our faithful
Babette."</p>

<p>Before the Curé could reply Jules intervened, scratching his old
grey head.</p>

<p>"I hide not from them, Mademoiselle; I will stay and guard the
Château and keep them out, if I can, barbarians that they are, making
war on women and children."</p>

<p>"They will shoot you, Jules, if you are so foolish," his mistress
reminded him. His answer was a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"A man dies but once&mdash;that is to say, a good man, who has faith
in God and does his duty."</p>

<p>So saying, Jules went back to take up his waiting duty.</p>

<p>The Curé departed the way he had come, and Julie Ledru, with
a feeling of strange calm upon her, hurried indoors to make her few
simple preparations. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Barbette'">Babette</ins>, the elderly servant, one of the best of
the old Brabant type, was cool and ready for any emergency, and in
an incredibly short time they had packed some food and a few necessaries
in two considerable baskets. Then Mademoiselle Ledru essayed the
task she dreaded&mdash;that of awaking her two young charges, and preparing
them for the ordeal through which they had to pass.</p>

<p>They were still asleep, in two beds side by side, in one of the
pleasantest rooms of the Château. Rosalie Bentham, fair and rosy, like
an English flower, her golden hair lying on her pillow like an aureole,
and Biddy Connaught, the dark-eyed Irish girl, whose long black lashes
swept her cheek, while her dimpled chin was in her open palm, as she
smiled over some passing imagery of her dream. Something caught
Julie Ledru's throat as she regarded these two pictures of innocence and
beauty, and reflected on the greatness of her charge. Both were only
children, entrusted to her care in the holidays, because their parents,
both in the exercise of duty, could not take them home. But with a
strong effort she controlled herself and awakened them gently. It was
a process of some length, because the sleep of youth is sound and deep,
but at last they were sitting up, drinking in her news.</p>

<p>"We have to run away and hide in the crypt until the Germans
have marched through the village. Do you hear, Biddy?" called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Rosalie, as she sprang from her bed and began to get into her clothes.
"But how ripping! What lots we shall all have to write about and to
tell them when we get home!"</p>

<p>Julie Ledru faintly, tremulously, smiled, and with her own hands she
assisted them to make a hasty toilet. Some coffee was ready for them
downstairs, for Babette was a methodical person, not easily upset.
Thus fortified, they left the Château presently, leaving Babette and
Jules in charge. Babette made the same excuse&mdash;some one must stay
to guard the place, and surely when they found nobody but two simple
old servants they would pass on.</p>

<p>Julie had no time to argue; perhaps even she did not fully realise
the peril to which these two faithful souls thus willingly exposed themselves.
She looked back on their serene faces as she passed through the
gate, and it was the last time she was to look on them in life. She
never saw them again, nor found them. They disappeared in the ruins
of La Royat as many had disappeared in other ruins, leaving no trace
behind. At the church, which was but a few paces off, they found the
Curé busy arranging shelter. It was a very tiny village, and the number
of those willing to accept the shelter he offered and, indeed, advised was
comparatively few. For though a simple they were a brave people,
nor could they conceive of a wickedness and barbarity that would seek
to destroy innocent souls who had naught to do with war. So they
went about their ordinary avocations as usual, a trifle more apprehensively
perhaps, but none the less bravely, and the morning wore on.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 207px;">
<img src="images/i_160.png" width="207" height="300" alt="soldier looking at sign" />
</div>
<p>The Curé took his charges, about twenty souls in all, down the
narrow stairs to the crypt, where he had already provided light and such
small comforts as he could spare from his own store.</p>

<p>"Isn't it ripping, Biddy?" asked Rosalie, but perhaps her young voice
had lost a little of its gallant ring. But Biddy, who had the imaginative
temperament of her race, shivered a little, and burst into tears. It was
strange and ominous to come in out of the warm, hopeful sunshine to
this place of tombs, an adventure with which the child could very well
have dispensed. The church was very old, and many
who had been born in Coutane had never seen the crypt.
Its very existence was unknown to a large number,
and the entrance to it was so cunningly arranged, and
so difficult of access, that it was of all hiding-places in
the village the most secure.</p>



<p>Then there was always the belief, founded on all
precedent of war, that the sacred things would be
respected, and sanctuary in God's house left undesecrated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The hours seemed long down there and the stillness profound.
Not a sound from the upper air penetrated to that strange hiding-place.
Though sure of their sanctuary, it seemed natural to lower their
voices, to move softly, and even to watch apprehensively. Even the
two girls, usually so high-spirited, found themselves naturally becoming
quiet. It was only the very little children, of whom there were five,
who, unconscious of danger, crowed and laughed and babbled in their
usual glee. These little ones provided incessant interest and occupation
for the two girls, and Julie Ledru smiled as she watched their pretty
efforts to amuse and keep them quiet. She had brought her watch, and
it pointed to nine o'clock at the moment when they heard a dull thud
several times repeated, which caused them all to start and look at one
another in quick alarm.</p>

<p>"It is the guns," said old Monsieur Rollin, whose legs were twisted
with rheumatism, so that they had half-carried him down the steps of
the crypt. "They have come, and are starting their fiendish work."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_161.png" width="500" height="349" alt="soldier on the road" />
</div>

<p>No one could gainsay him, and for the next half-hour they had to
listen to a repetition of the same sound gradually getting nearer and
nearer. Presently their terror was increased by the deafening roar of
artillery much nearer and the sound of falling masonry, indicating that
the church itself, cradle and sanctuary of the life of Coutane for
centuries, had not been respected. The two English girls, now
thoroughly frightened, clung together fearfully, and the whole little
company, some of them on their knees, did not exchange a word. After
a time the firing ceased, and they were left to absolute stillness. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
none of them moved, or offered to go up to discover what had
actually happened in the village.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 189px;">
<img src="images/i_162.png" width="189" height="275" alt="carrying a lantern" />
</div>

<p>After what seemed an interminable interval&mdash;in reality it
was not more than a couple of hours from the moment the din
ceased overhead&mdash;the door of the crypt was cautiously opened,
and the Curé looked in. He was all dishevelled, his face blackened
with smoke, and his whole appearance that of a man who had
seen some terrible and haunting vision.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are, my children," he cried as they crowded
round him; "I think you may come up presently, but be prepared
to have your hearts broken. A regiment of the enemy has
passed through, and left nothing behind. Mademoiselle, the
Château is in flames, and the beautiful spire of the church has been
blown to pieces, and at the Mairie the devastation is complete. But,
above all, we mourn the death of so many helpless people&mdash;I myself
escaped by a miracle."</p>

<p>"Have they gone?" asked Mademoiselle, with a shivering breath.</p>

<p>"They have, and I think that they are pursued, and that this was
the hurried work of destruction prompted by hatred and revenge.
Will you come up now and see for yourselves, or remain here in safety
through the night? Alas! you will find no other refuge, Mademoiselle,
for your home is in ruins."</p>

<p>Such fear was upon them that with one accord they determined
to remain in the crypt until the dawn of another day.</p>

<p>Even the natural gaiety and high spirits of youth were not proof
against the terror which all felt might swoop down upon them again at
any moment.</p>

<p>They had arranged themselves as comfortably as possible to
pass the night, when they were suddenly disturbed by the grating of
a door and the swinging of a lantern. All scrambled to their feet,
some of them shrieking and hiding their eyes, certain that there had been
a fresh arrival of the invaders, and that instant death would meet them.</p>

<p>But once more the Curé smiled upon them reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Courage, my children! Our trouble is for the moment at an end.
Our own brave soldiers have arrived. It is as I said&mdash;they are in pursuit,
but part of them will camp here to-night. Alas! we have little or no
food to offer them, for the barbarians stripped the village of everything."</p>

<p>Then Julie Ledru, hurriedly throwing on her cloak, said she would
ascend with the Curé and give what stores she could from the Château.</p>

<p>"But it is no more, my daughter. You have forgotten how I told
you yesterday that they have burned it to the ground."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"But my stores are hidden in the grotto in the garden, and there is
a secret passage to it. I think, Father, they had not time, or did not
take it, to explore, and we shall find things there. I have been putting
them away since the war began."</p>

<p>So in the pearly dawn, a strange sight was to be seen in the
trampled, desecrated garden of the Château behind its smoking ruins.</p>

<p>Led by Julie Ledru, the Commandant of the troops that had halted
in the village found stores sufficient to help assuage the hunger of his
men. He was profuse in his thanks.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you in exchange, Mademoiselle?" he asked, as he
stood at the salute. Instantly Mademoiselle pointed to her charges,
who, still shivering a little with fear, yet profoundly, poignantly
interested in the extraordinary scene of desolation, in what but a few
hours ago was one of the fairest spots in Belgium.</p>

<p>"These are my English children. Get them to their parents,
Monsieur le Capitaine, and I shall be amply repaid."</p>

<p>The officer shook his head.</p>

<p>"Easier said than done, Madame; but leave it, and I will see what can
be done. How is it you have been so indiscreet as to remain here? You
ought to have removed yourself, and them, while there was still time."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle shook her head.</p>

<p>"We imagined we were of no account, and we have had no news
for several days. We were assured that the tide of battle had flowed in
a different direction."</p>

<p>"It is everywhere, Mademoiselle&mdash;an evil flood, rolling over the
whole of our country. But, look you, I will see what can be done."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and that evening after dark, in an
armoured motor-car, Julie Ledru and her charges were driven for hours
and miles by tortuous ways which kept them out of danger, until they
reached Ghent, where it was still possible to get a train for Ostend.</p>

<p>Two days later, she landed in England with Rose and Biddy, herself
utterly ruined, her home gone, one of the most pitiful of the refugees.</p>

<p>But she was welcomed warmly and gratefully by Biddy's father,
and in a few days' time was safe in a warm, comfortable home on the
Irish coast, where Rose, too, was made welcome, until her own relatives
in India could be communicated with.</p>

<p>It was an experience the two girls would never forget, one which
will remain with them through life as a very poignant personal
experience of the Great War.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Fleur-de-lis</span> had been christened Marie Hortense Amélie Dupont:
Marie for her mother, Hortense and Amélie in honour of the two
Vicomtesses de Rastignac, sole survivors of the proud old Royalist
family in whose service Marie's mother and grandmother had lived,
and into whose service Marie herself had been born. But when <i>la
petite</i> Marie Hortense Amélie was a mere blossom of babyhood she
forsook the name that the priest had given her as he touched her
downy head with the holy water, and chose instead to be called Fleur-de-lis&mdash;a
name, in sooth, much better suited to a noble daughter of
the Rastignacs than to a child of Marie Dupont, maker of tissue-paper
flowers, and Pierre Dupont, street musician.</div>

<p>Fleur-de-lis had first opened her eyes in a very humble chamber,
but it was large enough to hold a deal of sweet content, which grew
all the sweeter when she came to share it. There were only two rooms
for father, mother, and child, and these were in a dreary tenement
house, for Pierre Dupont, a stranger in a strange land, was having
a desperate struggle with poverty. On being discharged from the
hospital, where he had passed through the dangerous illness that left
him a maimed and broken man, he had to begin the world all over
again, and begin it single-handed, in very truth. There were few
things to which he could turn his one hand; one of them was the
crank of a street-piano, and in a modest example of that modern
instrument of torture he accordingly invested the last of his savings.
He was much too good for it, but by regarding it distinctly as a hated
object which should be discarded the moment something better
appeared, he mastered his aversion, and, by wheeling it through the
streets from morning till night, he managed to live, for there were
always people who wanted to hear it, and others who did not, so
that between the two classes he scraped together enough for his
frugal needs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Marie was young and pretty and loyal, and when affairs were
most desperate she offered to take the baby Fleur-de-lis and accompany
her husband, gathering the pennies in a tambourine, while he ground
so-called music from the piano with the left arm, that grew so weary
in the monotonous service. But there was not a trace of the mountebank
in Pierre Dupont, nor a drop of beggar's blood in his veins. He
was poor and crippled, but he had still the self-respecting pride of
the peasant whose people had served noble families, and who know
what true nobility is. He could injure the dead-and-gone Rastignacs,
if he must, by trundling about a second-hand street-piano, but he
could at least spare them the insult of adding a monkey or a woman
to the procession. So Maman Marie, loving him more than ever for
his chivalrous regard of her, took up an almost forgotten pastime
of her girlhood, and fell to making artificial flowers, which she sold
to an old woman who stood on the street corners and offered them
to the passers-by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">

</div>

<p>The two rooms in the tenement house were as neat as care and
thrift could make them. The windows opened only into the court, it is
true, but Pierre and Marie did not need to look out of doors to get
a pleasant view, for they could look at each other, and at the baby;
besides, the glass was spotlessly clean and hung with equally spotless
curtains. The floors were uncarpeted, but there was never a speck of
dust on them. The little kitchen where Marie worked had a not
unappetising fragrance from the <i>pot-au-feu</i> that simmered on the stove;
it had also a gleam of sunshine in it for a few hours each day. Sometimes
when Pierre left his incubus for half an hour and ran home for a
mouthful of bread and soup, he looked at Maman Marie sitting by her
table in the sunshine, her scissors gleaming among the paper-flower
petals, and at Fleur-de-lis, sitting at her feet playing with the rainbow-coloured
scraps, and then he fell on his knees beside them, and, putting
his arm about them both, forgot that it was the only one he had, forgot
that he was poor and crippled, and that the future was all uncertain,
remembering only that he had home and wife and child, and that life,
with all its hardships, was inexpressibly dear to him. For it happens,
sometimes, that a poet's soul is lodged in a very humble tenement, and
a love that would do honour to a knight blossoms and flourishes in the
midst of mean and pitiful surroundings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 64px;">
<img src="images/i_165a.png" width="64" height="100" alt="Fleur-de-lis" />
</div>

<p>Fleur-de-lis's cradle had curtains made of a bit of tricolour, and
from the centre of the canopy there hung a medal of the Virgin swinging
on a narrow ribbon of blue. The cradle itself was a wooden box, and
Marie, with a maternal ingenuity that surmounted the lack of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
materials, had lined the inside of the hood with tissue-paper flowers;
white and blue fleurs-de-lis to match those on the faded satin coverlet, a
fragment of ancient grandeur where the Rastignac coat-of-arms was
intertwined with the Bourbon lilies of France. And when the baby's
vagrant gaze wandered to the flowery heaven above her head, and her
pink fingers reached to touch it and to stroke the soft counterpane,
Maman Marie would tell her the name of the posies; and so after a
time, when she discovered that people and things possessed names,
Marie Hortense Amélie, Mademoiselle Bébé, elected to call herself
Fleur-de-lis. It was the first word she lisped, and she attached it to
herself with the utmost complacency. It was appropriate enough,
for she looked as if she might have been originally intended for a
flower, and then somehow a soul had strayed into the flower, and it
had fluttered down to earth as a child&mdash;a curious blossom to come from
lowly stock, a kind of tender and beautiful miracle wrought out of
common clay by the fashioning and refining power of love. At times,
when Marie sat at her work and looked at Fleur-de-lis cooing and
smiling under her tri-coloured curtains, she forgot the strange land
outside the windows, and the Babel of strange tongues in the crowded
tenement, and as her deft, brown fingers shaped the tissue flowers, she
saw in fancy the poppies and the wheat and the lilies of her native
Breton fields. She saw the sun shining on the old château, her
mother hanging a chaplet on the baron's tomb in the little oratory,
the aged baroness walking sadly in the pleasance. All, all were gone.
The château was dismantled. The proud old family, rooted for
centuries to the soil of Brittany, had gradually lost its land and its
riches, till now there was only one frail old dame, poor and childless,
to maintain the ancient title. All these memories, half sad, half
sweet, flitted in and out of Marie's mind as she snipped and trimmed
and twisted and shaped, her head on one side to view the result,
like a little brown pheasant regarding a berry; and if Fleur-de-lis
slept, she hummed a Breton lullaby as she twined her paper nosegays.
What wonder, then, that there was a French air about them that
attracted purchasers?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

</div>

<p>So "hope clad in April green" made life worth living for father
and mother; and, as for Fleur-de-lis, she was a child; and she had love,
and that was enough, and it is sad when we grow so old that it does
not suffice for us. But these days, so full of care and anxiety, of
weariness and self-denial tinged with happiness, came to an end; for
when Fleur-de-lis was two years old, Maman Marie, young and strong,
passionately in love with life, desperately needed by husband and child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
had to leave them, to journey on alone to another far country, having
just grown wonted to this.</p>

<p>Then the light went out of the two little rooms that had been
home; indeed, it seemed to go out of the world altogether. Hard
times and yet harder ones descended upon poor Pierre Dupont.
Marie's earnings no longer helped to swell the slender income, and
there were no willing woman's hands to cut and plan and save, to
contrive and embellish. Added to this, the piano suddenly grew
uncertain, and subject to grave musical lapses, attacks of aphasia in the
middle of some tunes, and of asthma in the middle of others; so that
the hoot of the stony-hearted bystander and the ruffianly small boy
became familiar to Pierre's ears; for he could not afford to buy new
cylinders to fit into the old instrument, and to keep it up to the
demands of the street, which is always delighted if you "cannot sing
the old songs," and wishes the latest melody to the exclusion of
everything else.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/i_165b.png" width="252" height="100" alt="Two" />
</div>

<p>Fleur-de-lis had been left in the care of a woman for many weeks
after Marie's death, but the sight of her tear-stained face at night,
the tender frenzy with which she lifted her arms to her father when he
came in, the sob of joy with which she buried her head in his coat, the
sigh of content with which she stroked his cheek between every
mouthful of bread and milk as she sat on his knee eating her meagre
supper&mdash;all this was too much for his loving heart. He had a small
sum of money that he had been hoarding to attach "Annie Rooney"
and "Comrades" to his unfashionable instrument, that he might
appease the public by the gratification of its darling wishes, and withdraw
the Boulanger march from its sated ears. This money he took
and went to a carpenter's shop in the neighbourhood. After many
explanations in his broken English, and many diagrams rudely drawn
on paper, the carpenter succeeded in building a primitive sort of baby-carriage
on one end of the street-piano. It had two wheels of its own,
and moved somewhat in harmony with the ancient instrument, which
had its difficulties of locomotion nowadays, as well as its musical
weaknesses. It had a drawer in which Fleur-de-lis's playthings were
kept&mdash;a battered doll, and boxes of her favourite scraps of bright
tissue-paper, the top of an old cotton umbrella, and a square of rubber
cloth like that which covered the piano when it rained. Here Fleur-de-lis
sat for many hours each day, happy and content. Pierre would
often take her out, and let her toddle by his side until she was tired,
when she would ascend her throne again. She wore a faded corduroy
jacket and an old woollen cap, but the flower-face that smiled above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
one, and the shower of chestnut hair that fell from beneath the other,
made you forget the poverty of her raiment. She was always clean and
sweet and comfortable, for Pierre, with the gentleness and patience of
a woman, washed and even mended, in a rough sort of a way, that the
child might not wholly miss a mother's care.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/i_168.png" width="83" height="400" alt="Two Fleur-de-lis" />
</div>

<p>Matters were going on in this way, rather from bad to worse,
when one November day father and child turned off a side-street, and
trundled into one of the fashionable avenues of the city. Pierre did
not often wheel his piano in front of brown-stone houses; it was too
old and wheezy to commend itself to localities accustomed to Seidl's
orchestra and the Hungarian band; but he scarcely knew to-day
whither his aimless feet were carrying him. For two weeks he had
gone out in the early morning and evening, leaving Fleur-de-lis asleep,
and had spent an hour or two in a vain quest for employment. But
his speech was broken, and he had only one arm&mdash;small wonder that
he failed when hundreds of men with two arms and nimbler tongues
were seeking the same thing and failing. People generally told him
that he ought to have stayed at home in his own country, where he
belonged; but that, as he had not done that, his next best plan was to
get back there at the earliest possible moment. If they had had time
to hear his justification for cumbering the earth of this free country,
he might have told them that he left France a strong young man, with
a strong young wife, and nearly fifteen hundred francs for the inevitable
rainy day; but that the rainy day had turned out to be a continual
downpour. He was wondering in a dull, vague sort of way, as they
rattled along over the cobblestones, why there was not bread for the
mouths that needed it. He wondered why, through no fault of his
own, he should have been maimed and crippled, why the loss of wife
should have followed the loss of limb, why there was not enough
work in the world for the people who were willing to do it, why
the children in the luxurious carriages that swept past him should
be swathed in furs while Fleur-de-lis's hands were blue in her ragged
mittens.</p>

<p>The universe was a mystery to Pierre Dupont. Search it as he
might, he could find no key to its curious distribution of miseries and
injustices. It seemed to him that, if some people would be content to
take a little less, there might be a little more for him; but he was by
no means certain of the soundness of this comfortable theory. A little
less gold plate on that harness, for instance, a yard less of lace on the
gown of that lady just stepping into her brougham, a single diamond
from her marquise ring&mdash;no, that superficial and snarling philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
did not help Pierre; there was neither envy nor rage in his heart as yet;
only a dull despair, a groping in the dark for a reason. Many of these
fortunate people, he supposed, deserved their fortunes, and had earned
them. They were cleverer than he, and had friends and opportunities
not vouchsafed, perhaps, to him. But why, since he was not clever,
and since he had neither friends nor opportunities, should he have been
deprived first of his principal means of self-support, and then of his
consolation, his courage, his other and braver self?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/i_168.png" width="83" height="400" alt="Two Fleur-de-lis" />
</div>

<p>And now it was the anniversary of Marie's death. That made the
day even harder to bear; for in some subtle way the remembrance of
certain hours or moments in a dear dead past is always more bitter
when we say to ourselves with a sigh, "It was just a year ago." Nature
was in no buoyant mood. A cold, drizzling rain, which ought to have
been snow, fell from time to time. The chill dampness made people
draw their wraps closer, and look drearily at the sky. Even the
children appeared less joyous than usual. Men turned up the bottoms
of their trousers and the collars of their coats, and hurried past one
another with a gruff nod that would have been a smile on a sunny day.
The bare branches of the trees shivered in the wind, and a few snowbirds
huddled themselves together cheerlessly here and there, as if even
they wished themselves farther south.</p>

<p>Pierre took out the rubber-cloth to cover his piano, and as he did
so he saw two children at the second story of a fine house near by. He
expected to be ordered away by a butler in livery at the moment he
disclosed the limitations of his musical instrument, but one could never
tell, the butler might be wooing the parlour-maid, so he drew up in front
of the drive-way. Fleur-de-lis had just walked several blocks, and, on
being lifted into her carriage, hoisted the dilapidated cotton umbrella
and wrapped her doll in an extra bit of calico. Pierre turned the
crank; the piano began on "Love's Young Dream." It seemed to him
that, with every revolution of the handle, he twisted the chords of his
aching heart, and that presently it would break, as the battered old
cylinders threatened to do, and for the same reason; because, alas! too
many tunes had been played upon them. When ill-fortune descends
too thick and fast upon the human spirit, unless it can draw fresh
accessions of strength from within, from without, from above, it sinks
inevitably into despair. Man may be conscious that he is made in the
image of God, fitted to endure, to conquer, all things, but for the time
he is common human clay, he faints and dies, or falls into a cowardly
lethargy that is worse than death. Such a moment had come to
Pierre Dupont. In his first crushing blow he had had a wife to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
shoulder to shoulder with him. He had now his passionate devotion
to his child; but in cold and weariness, in hunger and friendlessness, ill-fortune
and despair, would love be able to keep itself pure, noble, self-denying,
hopeful? There were ways of forgetting, of dulling one's self,
of blotting out memory for hours together.</p>

<p>His wants were comparatively simple; but, since he could not
realise them, why not give up the struggle? He did not wish for
a carriage or a palace; he wished to give up his vagrant life for some
labour by which he could maintain himself and give his child a start
towards honest womanhood. That was not extravagant, surely, and if
God were indeed in His heaven, and all were indeed right with the
world, it seemed to Pierre that it was none too much to ask.</p>

<p>He finished "Love's Young Dream," and began the "Boulanger
March." A young girl of eighteen or nineteen, with an open book in
her hand, joined the children at the window. She had a beautiful,
rather serious face, and it brightened into amusement, and then into
earnestness, as she caught sight of the quaint vehicle, of the child under
the faded umbrella, and of the empty sleeve of the musician. Pierre
ground on mechanically; it was "I dreamt that I dwelt in Marble
Halls" now, and he hoped that a dime would be flung from the window
before he came to "Within a Mile of Edinboro' Town," for that was
the weakest part of his repertoire. The group still stayed at the
window, and the crisis could not be delayed. The piano jerked through
several bars, stopped and repeated, wheezed and returned to the
"Boulanger March," then bounded again to "Edinboro' Town," and,
after several ineffectual attempts to finish it, made an asthmatic dash
into "No One to Love." Pierre looked anxiously under the <i>porte-cochère</i>
for the resentful butler; but the children shrieked with renewed
delight, and the young girl, going away from the window, presently
appeared, running down the drive-way, and slipping on her jacket as
she came. She approached the edge of the side-walk, for there was no
group about the piano, and, after a brief interview with Pierre, she left
a piece of silver with him, and went upstairs to her mother.</p>

<p>Janet Gordon was a great anxiety to her family. She was possessed
of the most extraordinary ideas, and no one could tell whence
they came, unless she became infected by them in some mysterious
fashion, as one is by microbes; at all events, she had never inherited
them in the legitimate way. At present, it is true, she had not been
introduced to society, but unless a great change of heart should make
itself apparent in a few months, she threatened to be no ornament to
her set, and no source of pride to an ambitious mother.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please look out of the window, mama," she said, bringing a breath
of raw air into her mother's flower-scented sitting-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon rose languidly, her tea-gown trailing behind her.
"What is it? Anything more than an organ-grinder who has been
rasping my nerves for five minutes? Oh, I see what you mean;
what an extraordinary combination&mdash;a child in one end of the
machine! Tell Héloise to give the man a dime, dear."</p>

<p>"I have given him a quarter myself, and have had a little talk
with him; he is quite different from the ordinary organ-grinder,
mama."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," said Mrs. Gordon good-naturedly; "all your
geese are swans, dear; a dime was quite enough for him."</p>

<p>"But he has only one arm, you see, mama."</p>

<p>"Of course, they never have; that is one of the tricks of the
trade. They bind one arm down to the side, and then slip the coat
over it. If you notice the man to-morrow he will have the left sleeve
hanging empty, and be playing with the right arm&mdash;it is more
effective."</p>

<p>"I'm sure there is no deception in this case, mama."</p>

<p>"Well, have it your own way, child; but pray don't take off his
coat to investigate, or you'll be catching some dreadful disease. It
does seem strange that poor people should always be so odiously dirty,
when water costs nothing."</p>

<p>"This man is as clean as possible, and so is the baby. Her name
is Fleur-de-lis; is it not quaint?"</p>

<p>"Just what I should expect; the dirtier and commoner they are,
the more regal and fanciful are the names they give their children. I
suppose your Fleur-de-lis is redolent of garlic, like the Pansies and
Violets of her class."</p>

<p>"No, she is not. She is as sweet as a rose; but her face is almost
blue with cold."</p>

<p>"Of course; what can the man expect if he trundles her about in
this weather? But I suppose he does it to enlist public sympathy. I
wonder why foreigners choose this particularly obnoxious way of getting
a living; and, if they must do it, why they go about with a decrepit old
instrument like that."</p>

</div>

<p>"Yes, his piano is very old, but he cannot afford to rent a better
one just at present. He said, in his broken English, 'I had not the
"Marche Boulanger," neither "Comrades," ma'mselle; it was then I
had what you call bad luck, and now, <i>mon Dieu!</i> it is that I have not
"Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay."' And, as for the child, he does not allow her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to take the money. I was dropping the quarter into her hand, when he
touched his cap, and said, '<i>Pardon</i>, give it to me, ma'mselle, <i>s'il vous
plaît</i>. You see, if ze monees keep putting in her hand she will grow up
one leetle beggair; she does not make ze muzeek, she does not push ze
piano&mdash;<i>bien</i>, she s'all not take zee monees."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary!" murmured Mrs. Gordon satirically, as she fitted
the cushions to her back more luxuriously; "you must repeat that
speech to your father. I actually believe that a new order of philosophic
mendicant is springing up to match the new charity. The new charity
does not wish to pauperise poverty, and the new poverty does not wish
to be pauperised; it is really very amusing."</p>

<p>"He is forced to take the child with him, because she has no mother,"
explained Janet.</p>

<p>"Of course she has no mother; they make it a point to have no
mother, or, if they have, they say they never knew who she was nor
where she is."</p>

<p>"They know where this mother is," said Janet gravely, "for she
died a year ago to-day."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/i_166.png" width="381" height="100" alt="Three Fleur-de-lis" />
</div>

<p>"Really, Janet, you exasperate me beyond measure, talking with
these low people, and allowing them to fill your mind with their falsehoods.
What is it you wish to do? You have given the man a quarter
already; that will quench his thirst for the present&mdash;Héloise, don't take
Fifine out without her blanket; she has been shivering on the rug before
the fire. Go back to your books, Janet. There will always be poor
organ-grinders, and most of them will have lost some of their arms or
legs, and all of them will have motherless, or worse than motherless,
children. It's the way of the world, and if you had the wealth of the
Indies you could never set things right&mdash;and, Héloise, come back a
moment; tell Madame Labiche that all three gowns must be sent home
to-morrow; and that I shall give her no more orders if she copies any
detail of my costumes for her other customers; and don't forget the
American Beauties, two dozen, the longest stems, and give that piano-child
at the gate ten cents more as you pass&mdash;I know it is not right,
Janet, but you are so insistent. The societies tell you never to bestow
alms without first looking into the case and finding whether it is really
deserving; but I am too weakly benevolent, and too lazy, besides, ever
to restrain&mdash;Janet, are you mad? Close that window at once!" And
Mrs. Gordon almost shrieked as she held down her frizzes with both
hands to shield them from the raw wind that rushed in from outside.
She would not have spoken so peremptorily had it not been for the
effect of the damp air on her coiffure. When her front <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'air'">hair</ins> was crimped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and protected from the assaults of the atmosphere she was an amiable
woman and could discuss any subject with calmness; but, deprive her of
twenty little gold-wire hair-pins daintily darned into her auburn frizzes,
and the invisible hair-net that Héloise pinned on with such nicety, and
she would not have listened to any argument in the world, even if it
concerned the salvation of her own soul.</p>

<p>"I was only going to speak a word to the man, mama," said Janet
apologetically.</p>

<p>"I believe you've been reading Tolstoi," returned her mother, going
to a mirror to repair damages. "Heavens! what a fright you've made
me! I wish those Russians would keep their universal brotherhood
ideas, and their cholera germs, at home."</p>

<p>"Dear mama, I scarcely know who Tolstoi is, except that he wrote
a novel about Anna somebody that you will not let me read. I do not
know what Tolstoi thinks about the wrong in the world, or how he
means to right it. I am not as sentimental as you and papa seem to
fancy. I am not certain that I ought to wrap that cold little child in
my new seal jacket, and run bare-headed by the side of the organ
collecting pennies for the poor one-armed man. I know that if I
should go down into the slums I should find a thousand others, and
that if I worked from year's end to year's end, and spent papa's entire
fortune, I could not make them all comfortable. But don't you believe,
mama, when, once in a while, need, poverty, and sorrow seem to
come directly in contact with plenty and riches and happiness, that
it means something, and that we ought to stop and think out something
special?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure I don't know, child; you confuse me so with your
persistence, and I can't think of anything while he sticks fast in the
middle of 'Edinboro' Town.' Give him half a dollar, if you like&mdash;anything
to get rid of him, though he succeeds wonderfully in amusing
the children."</p>

<p>"I don't want to give him any more money, mama," said Janet,
with a sigh. "I only feel as if I must not lose sight of the child&mdash;there
they are going!"</p>

<p>Pierre covered his piano, pinned the rubber-cloth more tightly
round Fleur-de-lis's throat, and was preparing to move off in the
direction of home, when Janet darted into the nursery, and, flinging
open the window in front of the children, called impetuously in her
clear young voice; "Bon soir, Fleur-de-lis! Bon soir, monsieur!
Revenez bientôt, je vous prie!"</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/i_166.png" width="381" height="100" alt="three Fleur-de-Lis" />
</div>

<p>Pierre's face lighted with surprise and pleasure, and, as he took off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
his cap he stammered excitedly, "Dis bon soir, bébé! Je vous remercis
mille-fois, ma'mselle; je reviendrai!"</p>

<p>He wheeled his piano to the shed where he kept it under cover at
night, and carried Fleur-de-lis home on his arm. After he had
undressed her and laid her in her crib, he took a crucifix from a drawer
where, in a moment of bitterness, he had hidden it the day before, and,
kissing it, restored it to its accustomed place above the head of his bed.</p>

<p>And the anniversary of Marie's death did not go out in utter blackness
after all; nor was it entirely because of the two pieces of silver that
had unexpectedly swelled the day's receipts. He had felt the magic of
a friendly voice; the beautiful little lady had spoken to him in his
native tongue; she had drawn a fragment of his story from him, and
thus relieved the weight at his heart; she had smiled on the child, and
kissed her; she had asked him to come again. And as he fell asleep
he whispered, "Merci, mille-fois, ma'mselle; je reviendrai."</p>

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
